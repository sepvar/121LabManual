    <introduction>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Physics is a science which is based on precise measurements of the seven fundamental physical quantities, three of which are:
    time (in seconds), length (in meters) and mass (in kilograms); and all of these measurements have an experimental uncertainty
    associated with them.  It is very important for the experimenter to estimate these experimental uncertainties for every
    measurement taken.   There are three factors that must be taken into account when estimating the uncertainty of a measurement:
    <ol>
    <li><p>statistical variations in the measurements,</p></li>
    <li><p>using one-half of the smallest division on the measurement instrument,</p></li>
    <li><p>any mechanical motions of the apparatus.</p></li>
    </ol>
    Physicists study the physical relationships between these defined fundamental quantities and usually give a name to the
    newly derived physical quantity.  These derived physical quantities have units which are combinations of the units of the
    fundamental ones.  For example, the product of the lengths (in meters, m) of the three sides of a cube is called volume and
    has units of <m>\unit{m^3}</m>.  The ratio of mass to volume is called density and has units of
<quantity><unit prefix="kilo" base="gram" /><per base="meter" exp="3" /></quantity>.
    The concepts of volume and
    density are therefore derived from the fundamental physical quantities, rather than fundamental themselves.

    <title>Student Outcomes</title>

    <p>In this exercise, students should learn how to to make precise and accurate length measurements with a meter stick and
    two types of calipers, how to read a vernier scale, and how to estimate uncertainty in a measurement.   Students will make
    use of the relationship of the fundamental properties of mass and length to the derived concepts of volume and density.

                            How does the distance from zero to five compare to the distance from one to six?

                            <p>You should figure out how to make efforts to correct for zero-point errors.</p>
                            <p>For each instrument, if the measurement you consider to have zero-length is not actually <q>zero</q>,
                                then you can handle that in the same way that you know the distance from 1 to 6 (in this case, subtract 1 from any measurement you make) or from 2 to 7  (in this case, subtract 2 from any measurement you make) or from 10 to 15 (in this case, subtract 10 from any measurement you make) . </p>
                            <p>You will also need to concern yourself with whether this uncertainty is

                            <p>You should figure out how to make efforts to correct any parallax errors.
                                It may help to determine whether this uncertainty is

                            <p>When you measure the diameter of a sphere, it might be difficult to get the caliper precisely at the full diameter.
                            If you are off, then you will necessarily be measuring a smaller value.  This is a systematic error that can be corrected for.
                            Since any mistake necessarily gives a value that is too small, then measuring it multiple times and finding the largest value
                            will minimize this uncertainty.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, if you measure an egg, you would not expect the diameter to be the same.
                            Clearly for an egg, there is no reasonable single value to use as The Diameter.
                            In this case, the question of finding the diameter does not make sense, and by measuring in a systematic pattern,
                            you can determine that the shape is not spherical.</p>

                            <p>Since systematic errors tend to be either too big or too small (in a predictable or explainable way),
                            you should track the uncertainties and recognize if this measurement
                            causes your result to be more likely too big or more likely too small.</p>

    <title>The Vernier Caliper</title>

    <p>The vernier scale was invented by Pierre Vernier in 1631.   This scale has the advantage of enabling the user to
    determine one additional significant figure of precision over that of a straight ruler.</p>

    <p>For example, this eliminates the need for estimating to the tenth of a millimeter on the metric ruler.
    The vernier caliper, shown in <xref ref="f-vernier" text="type-global" />,
    can measure distances using three different parts of the caliper: outside diameters (large jaws), inside diameters (small jaws),
    and depths (probe).  You should locate these three places on your caliper.  The vernier device consists of the main scale and
    a movable vernier scale.  The fraction of a millimeter can be read off the vernier scale by choosing the mark on the
    vernier scale which best aligns with a mark on the main scale.</p>

    <title>The Micrometer Caliper</title>

    <p> A micrometer caliper is shown in <xref ref="f-micrometer" text="type-global" />.
    This instrument is used for the precise length measurement of a small object.
    The object is placed with care between the anvil and the rod.  It is very important to not tighten down on the object with a vise-like grip.
    Tightening with force will <term>decalibrate</term> the micrometer (causing a zero-point error).
    The rotating cylinder moves the rod, opening or closing the rod onto the object.
    There is a rachet, at the far end, for taking up the slack distance between the anvil, the object and the rod, so again do not
    over-tighten with the rotating cylinder.  The linear dimension of the object can be read from the scale.  Rotating the cylinder
    one revolution moves the rod 0.5 millimeters.  The rotating cylinder has 50 marks on it.  Read the mark on the rotating cylinder
    that aligns with the central line on the main scale.</p>

        <caption><term>The Micrometer Caliper</term></caption>
        <image source="micrometer.JPG" width="100%" />
        <description>Notice on the coarse scale, that the lower lines read (1, 2, 3, <ellipsis /> 6 in this picture) and the higher lines read
        the half-marks (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, <ellipsis /> 6.5 in this picture).  The location of the turning dial tells you where to read the
        coarse scale (6.5 mm).  The center line of the coarse scale tells you where to read the fine scale.
        This is 23.0 (in units of <m>\times 10^{-2}</m> mm), but not 23.5 and not 22.5 so the precision is 0.5 (in these units).
        This measurement in mm reads <m>6.5 \unit{mm} + 0.230\unit{mm} = 6.730 \pm 0.005 \unit{mm}</m>.

    <introduction>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Suppose you are standing in front of a dart-board.  You have a large number of darts and you throw the darts one at a time,
    trying to hit a 1 cm thick vertical line drawn on the dart-board.  Since you have a very good aim, let us say that <m>45\%</m> of the
    darts hit the line.   This then means that you miss the line <m>55\%</m> of the time; with a significant number of these misses being
    between .5 to 1.5 cm either to the left or to the right from the center of the line, and with a smaller number of misses being
    between 1.5 to 2.5 cm from the center line.</p>

    <p>Is there some mathematical way of characterizing how good you are at this game?  What, for example, is the probability of
    missing the line by 1 cm?  The statistical analysis of random fluctuations in data can help answer these questions.   The word
    <q>statistical</q> implies that a relatively large set of similar measurements of a given physical quantity is available.  The
    random fluctuations in the data can be measured with the use of a mathematical term called the <q>standard deviation.</q></p>

    <p>Suppose you collect data on a large number of throws, separating the data into categories (bins): The number of darts on
    the line, the number within .5 to 1.5 cm from the center, the number within 1.5 to 2.5 cm, etc.  A plot of this data with the
    dart positions on the x-axis and the number of darts hit within each bin plotted on the y-axis is called a histogram (see
    <xref ref="f-histogram" text="type-global" />).  The envelope of this graphical data set is bell shaped, and is called a Gaussian or a Normal
    distribution curve.</p>

        <assemblage>
        <figure xml:id="f-histogram">
        <title>A sample histogram</title>
        <image source="darthistogram.jpg" width="100%" />

        A sample histogram for the number of darts binned by distance from the centerline.
        </caption>
        </figure>
        </assemblage>

    <p>The <q>standard deviation</q> is a measure of the spread or width of the histogram data.  A small standard deviation
    means that there is a small spread in the data about the central mean value and implies that the data cluster closely
    about one value.   That is, there is a high degree of precision in the measurements.</p>

    <p>The area beneath the curve, or below a part of the curve represents the probability of occurrence.  For example, the
    area beneath the curve between plus and minus one standard deviation from the mean represents a <m>68\%</m> probability of your
    next throw falling within this range.  The area beneath the curve between plus and minus two standard deviations from the
    mean represents a <m>95\%</m> probability of your next throw falling within this range.</p>

    <p>In this experiment, you will study the use of the <q>standard deviation</q> in the statistical analysis and probability
    involved with flipping pennies.</p>

    <title>Experimental Objectives</title>

    <introduction><p>The goal of the experiment is to determine how the mean, standard deviation, and standard deviation of the mean depend on
    the amount of data (number of samples) taken.  You should also consider how well the data fit to a normal distribution.</p>

    <section>
    <title>Student Outcomes</title>

    <p>In this experiment, you should learn
    <ol>
    <li><p> the formulas for and the roles of the mean, the standard deviation, and the standard deviation of the mean in the
    statistical analysis of data containing random errors,</p></li>
    <li><p> how to create histograms and scatter plots,</p></li>
    <li><p> how to include trendlines on scatter plots, and </p></li>
    <li><p> why more data is always better.</p></li>
    </ol></p>

    </section>
    <section>
    <title>Pre-Lab Considerations</title>
    <p><ul>
    <li><p> Define the following, both in a sentence and with a mathematical formula:  mean, standard deviation
    (sometimes called the standard deviation of a single observation), and standard deviation of the mean.
    Be sure to describe the difference between these two terms.</p></li>
    <li><p> Define the following:  histogram, probability, <ampersand /> probability distribution (Normal distribution).</p></li>
    <li><p> What does the total area under the Normal distribution curve represent?</p></li>
    <li><p> How should the axes of the histogram of the data you will take for this lab be labeled?
    Give a very specific scale for the x-axis.  (Hint: Read the procedure below.)</p></li>

    <title>Procedure</title>

        <paragraphs><title>Materials</title>
        <p>A supply of pennies.</p>
        </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs><title>Procedure</title>
    <p>Each individual will receive 20 pennies and will then simultaneously toss all of the pennies.
    Count the number of heads, and repeat 25 times.   Each individual will then have collected 25 pieces of data.</p>

    <p>After doing this, you will 25 <q>counts</q> of the number of heads among that 20 coins.  Your lab partner will also have 25 <q>counts</q>.  The two of you together have access to 50 <q>counts</q>.  You, your partner, and the pair of people near you will together have 100 <q>counts</q> among you.  You will therefore be able to consider a histogram for your <m>N=25</m>, another histogram for your <m>N=50</m>, etc.  After you consider each of these histograms, you will consider how the shape a histogram changes as <m>N</m> increases.</p>

    <section>
    <title>Analysis</title>

    <p><ul>
    <li><p> Calculate the mean, the standard deviation  and the standard deviation of the mean for your first ten tosses and
    for all 25 tosses.  Show your calculations.</p></li>
    <li><p> Make a histogram plot (by hand in your note book) for your 25 tosses.   On this histogram superimpose a sketch
    of your best guess of the corresponding Normal distribution curve.</p></li>
    <li><p> How well does your data fit a normal distribution curve?  Explain the reasons for any large discrepancies.</p></li>
    <li><p> Obtain histograms and calculations of the mean, the standard deviation and the standard deviation of the mean for
    the following data sets:
    <ol>
        <li><p> your lab group,  </p></li>
        <li><p> about 1/2 of the class, and </p></li>
        <li><p> the entire class.   </p></li>
    </ol>
    These histograms can be obtained with the use of a computer program, provided by the instructor.</p></li>
    <li><p> Draw graphs of:  the mean, the standard deviation, the standard deviation of the mean, versus the number of data entries.
    Use the standard deviation of the mean  as the error bars for both the mean and the standard deviation,  draw these error bars on
    these two graphs.</p></li>
    <li><p> Describe how the values of the mean, the standard deviation, and the standard deviation of the mean,
    change as the number of data items in the set increases.  What can you infer about the accuracy and about the precision of the
    data as more and more observations are made?</p></li>
    <li><p> Show that the standard deviation of the mean varies inversely as the square root of the number of data items in the sample.
    How well does the data in this lab agree with this prediction?   (Make a graph of the standard deviation of the mean versus the
    square root of the number of data items in the sample.)</p></li>

    <title>Questions</title>

    <exercisegroup>
        <exercise>
            <statement><p> What is the probability of flipping the 20 pennies and getting 5 heads, or 8 heads, or 10 heads, or 15 heads?
            Answer this question by analyzing your data, the entire class' data and the normal distribution curve fit to your data.
            Explain any differences between these sets.</p></statement>
            <hint><p>Consider the percentage of total throws that produce each number of heads.</p></hint>
            <hint xml:id="h-percent-thrown"><p>The percentage of total throws that give 5 heads is the number of throws that gave 5 heads divided by the total number of throws.</p></hint>
            <hint><p>You might consider this percentage (of throws that produces 5 heads) for <m>N=25</m> versus <m>N=50</m> versus other values of <m>N</m> to explore the stability of this percentage.  (Remember that more data is better.)</p></hint>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
            <statement><p> What percentage of your individual readings fall within plus or minus
                one standard deviation,
                two standard deviations?
            Compare your answer to the theoretical answer from a normal distribution curve.
            What are the percentages for the class data?</p></statement>
            <hint><p><xref ref="h-percent-thrown" text="type-global" /> explains finding a percent of throws.</p></hint>
            <hint><p>If the mean is <m>10.12</m> and the standard deviation is <m>2.74</m>, then <q>within plus or minus one standard deviation</q> implies that you should consider the percentage of times you get between <m>7.38</m> and <m>12.86</m>.  This is larger than 7 and smaller than 13.  So, consider how many throws gave 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 heads.</p></hint>
            <hint><p>To compare to the theoretical answer, you can figure out the actual mathematical formula, but you can also use the <q>Gaussian Prediction</q> column in the Excel spreadsheet for the corresponding range.</p></hint>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
            <statement><p> Does the height of the histograms change as a function of the number of trials?
                If so, how?</p></statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
            <statement><p> How does the width at 1/2 the maximum height for the histograms change as a function of the number of trials?
                Label this width on your histograms.  Is this width a reasonable estimate of the standard deviation?</p></statement>
            <hint><p>To get the <q>full-width at half-maximum</q> on your histogram, find the mean on the horizontal axis and note the vertical value of that peak (read the vertical axis).  Half this peak value and then find the smallest number of heads thrown that is at least this half-value and the largest number of heads thrown that is at least this half-value.</p>
                <p>For example, if the mean of your data is <m>10.12</m>, then perhaps you had <m>6</m> throws that resulted in 10 heads (the number of heads closest to the mean).  Half of the <m>6</m> throws is <m>3</m> throws.  So, you will likely have find that you have fewer than <m>3</m> throws for 6-or-fewer heads but more than <m>3</m> throws for 7-or-more heads.  On the other end, you will likely find that you have fewer than <m>3</m> throws for 14-or-more heads but more than <m>3</m> throws for 13-or-fewer heads.  This says that the <q>full-width at half-maximum</q> is the range from 7 heads to 13 heads, which is a width of 6-heads thrown.  You should consider how this <q>full-width at half-maximum</q> compares to your standard deviation.</p>
                <p>(Please remember that you not actually throwing heads, you are throwing coins. Do not decapitate your lab partner.)</p></hint>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
            <statement><p> Does the standard deviation of a single observation and/or does the standard deviation of the mean change
                significantly as the number of tosses increase?

            <p>You should notice that the subsections in this section parallel the subsections in <xref ref="ss-AccAnalysis" text="title" />.

        <subsection xml:id="sss-FlatTrack"><title>Cart and Flat Track</title>
        <p>Log into the computer (so you can save your data to your network drive) and then open Pasco Capstone.
        (<xref ref="s-Capstone" text="type-global" /> will provide some instructions for setting up the software and connecting the equipment.)
        Connect the motion sensor to the computer interface.
        Set the data rate of the motion sensor at <m>50 \unit{Hz}</m>.
        Place a steel ball on the track and adjust the leveling screw at one end of the track to see if the ball rolls one way or the other.
        This will roughly level your track.
        Place the sensor about 20 cm from the end of the track, because this is the minimum distance detected by the sensor.
        (You might need to use the <q>sail</q> for the sensor to see the cart.)</p>

        <p>Place the cart on the track.  Capstone, via the sonic ranger, can measure the position and velocity of the cart as a function of time.
        (This is explained in <xref ref="s-Capstone" text="type-global" />.)

                        include a comment about how the velocity versus time graph will look when it goes uphill versus when it goes downhill.
                        Should these be the same?</p>

                    <hint><p>If the track is not level, sending the cart in one direction, it will be going uphill;
                        but in the other direction it will be going downhill.

        <p>We will take four sets of data: a slow, constant velocity towards the ranger; a slow, constant velocity away from the ranger;
        a faster, constant velocity towards the ranger; and a faster, constant velocity away from the ranger.
        The two slow speeds should be about the same and the two faster speeds should be about the same.

<introduction><title>Introduction to Forces</title>
    <p>Forces are related to the natural motion of bodies, where one object can affect the motion of another object.
    That is, forces are interactions between objects affecting their motion.
    Although the famous Greek philosopher Aristotle claimed that a force was necessary to <em>maintain</em> any motion,
    careful analysis by Italian physicist Galileo Galilei in the mid-<m>17^{\rm th}</m> century and by Sir Isaac Newton,
    a British mathematician and physicist (1642-1727), eventually distinguished the effects of friction and allowed
    Newton to create a mathematically consistent theory of motion.  These concepts were published in Newton's book
    <q>Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</q> in 1687, for which (among other accomplishments) Newton is
    regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time.</p>

    <p>All forces can be placed in one of two main categories.
    First, there are natural (or fundamental) forces like the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force, or the nuclear forces.
    The gravitational force is a force on a body by another body (like the Earth), this force is an interaction between their two masses.
    The electromagnetic force is an interaction between the charges of two bodies.
    These forces may act on an object without any direct physical contact between the two bodies.
    This type of force is sometimes called an <q>action at a distance</q> force.
    All other forces are in a second category called <q>contact forces.</q></p>

    <subsection><title>Newton's First law</title>

        <p><quote>
        If there are no forces acting, then objects will remain at rest or, if not at rest, will maintain their velocity.
        </quote>
        If this is true, then we can study the forces acting on a body based on the motion of the body,
        specifically through the change in the velocity of an object.</p>

    </subsection>
    <subsection><title>Newton's Second Law</title>

        <p>Not only is a force necessary to change the motion (to cause an acceleration),
        the amount of acceleration that a force causes is predictable and is inversely proportional to the mass.
        The same sized force causes a small mass to accelerate a lot and a large mass to accelerate a little.
        This is expressed by the equation:
        <me> \vec F_{\rm net} = m \vec a. </me>
        The net force, <m>\vec F_{\rm net}</m>, is the vector sum of all forces acting on an object.
        If we have an extended object (such as a weight hanging off of a table, but connected to a cart that is on the table),
        then we need only consider forces that are <q>external</q> to the system:
        So long as both objects accelerate at the same rate, we do not need to consider the <q>internal</q> tension that
        the string exerts between the connected bodies.</p>

    </subsection>
    <subsection><title>Newton's Third Law</title>

    <p>Inherent in the description of a force is that it is an interaction between objects:
    there must always be two objects that interact.  These objects exert equal and opposite forces on each other.  That is,
    <quote>
        <p>If there is a force exerted on object 1 by object 2, then there is necessarily and simultaneously
        a force exerted on object 2 by object 1 that is equal (in magnitude) and opposite (in direction) to the original force.</p>
    </quote>
    Remember that these two forces are on different objects and that the two bodies in direct contact exert forces on each other.
    Remember then that if there is contact between the object (any part of the system) and anything else then there is an
    outside force on the object (system) and that if there is no contact (the two bodies break contact) then there is no force.</p>

    </subsection>
</introduction>

    <objectives><title>Experimental Objective</title>

    <introduction><p>In this experiment, we will assume that the first law is true and focus on the second law.
    By measuring (a) the velocity versus time for a cart being pulled down a track and
    (b) the applied force that is pulling it, we can plot the acceleration versus the force
    and verify the validity of Newton's second law of motion: <m>\vec F_{\rm net} = m \vec a</m>.</p>
    </introduction>
    </objectives>

<section><title>Pre-Lab Considerations</title>

<paragraphs><title>Materials</title>
<p>A low-friction linear track with a wheeled cart and a pulley at one end of the track. Weights that can ride in the cart without jostling.  A string connecting the cart to a light-weight support for small masses, which sits over the pulley allowing the masses to fall vertically while pulling the cart horizontally. A <q>sonic ranger</q> that uses sonar to measure the position, velocity, and acceleration of the cart.</p>
</paragraphs>

    <ul>
    <li><p> A low-friction linear cart and track will be used, this reduces the friction between the cart and the track.</p></li>
    <li><p> A string will be connected to the cart and a known mass will be hanging from the end of the string (and over a pulley).
        The hanging mass will exert a constant horizontal force on the cart as the mass falls all the way to the floor.  This gives a constant acceleration to the cart.</p></li>
    <li><p> The sonic motion sensor will be used to measure the position of the cart as a function of time. </p></li>
    <li><p> The carts and tracks need to be handled with care.  Scratches can add friction to the system.</p></li>
    </ul>

</subsection>

<subsection><title>Procedure</title>
    <ul>
    <li><p> If the cart is given an initial push (without the hanging mass and string attached) then the cart should travel
        with a constant velocity down the horizontal track, if there are no other forces acting on the cart.
        Carry out  a couple of constant velocity runs on the track, to check for the effects of friction and
        to see how level the track is. The track may need a level adjustment.  Do runs in both directions.
        Maybe the track can be tilted so that the friction is countered by the tilt of the track.</p></li>
    <li><p> Connect a string to the cart and run it through the hole at the end of the track, then over a pulley.
        Make sure that the string is horizontal.  Measure the height of the string at both ends of the track,
        to see if the string is horizontal.</p></li>
    <li><p> The hanging mass should be much less than the mass of the cart.  Use a small plastic cup to hold the hanging masses.
        Measure the mass of  this cup.  The total mass of the system must be kept constant for all parts of the experiment.
        The hanging mass and the mass of the cart should vary, but their total must be kept constant, by moving small mass
        amounts from the cart to the hanging cup.  Record the mass of the cart, the hanging cup mass, and the extra masses
        which are to be transferred from the cart to the cup.</p></li>
    <li><p> Take data with Capstone and the motion sensor as the cart travels with constant acceleration down the track.
        Determine the acceleration of the cart from a linear regression using the velocity vs time data (a linear fit line in Capstone).
        Record the acceleration value and its uncertainty.</p></li>
    <li><p> Collect  7 data runs, where about 5 grams is transferred each time from the cart to the hanging mass.
        Determine the acceleration of the cart (and the uncertainty for the acceleration) for each of these 7 runs.</p></li>
    </ul>
</subsection>
</section>

<section><title>Analysis</title>

    <ul>
    <li><p> Make a graph of the acceleration of the system (y-axis) versus the weight <m>(mg)</m> of the hanging body (x-axis),
        should include 7 data points.    Do this in Excel.   Carry out a linear regression for this data set.
        Quote the  slope and intercept values, their uncertainties, their p-values, and the <m>R^2</m> value.
        Show a sample error bar (on the graph) for at least one of the points of this graph.</p></li>
    <li><p> Derive (show it completely)  an equation for the acceleration of the system versus the weight of the hanging body.
        Plot this theory equation on your graph (as a second series, a line but no points).</p></li>
    <li><p> Compare your graph to the predicted theoretical equation, that is compare the values of the slopes and intercepts.
        What is the physical significance of the slope and of the intercept from the graph?
        That is, what physical quantity does the slope of this graph equal?</p></li>
    <li><p> In many mechanics experiments, there may be deviations from the expected or theoretical results because of the effects of friction.
        Frictional forces are sometimes difficult to take into consideration.
        If there are deviations between your results and the predicted theory then try to distinguish whether they are
        caused by a tilt of the track, friction between the cart and the track or the friction between the string and the pulley.
        What might be expected in the results from these different systematic effects?
        That is, would the slope be expected to increase or decrease slightly because of the effects of friction?</p></li>
    <li><p> When designing experiments, it is important to keep control parameters; in this case a parameter which is kept constant.
        What parameter held this role in this experiment?</p></li>

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Friction is a force which retards the relative motion of any body while sliding over another body.
    The frictional force acting on a body is parallel to the surface that the object is sliding upon and it is
    directed opposite to the direction of motion.  The phenomenon of friction is rather complicated, especially
    at the microscopic level, because it is dependent on the nature of the materials of both contacting surfaces.
    The frictional force depends on the roughness or the irregularities of both surfaces.
    At the macroscopic level, the nature of this force can be described by a simple empirical law, first given by Leonardo da Vinci:
    <quote>
    The magnitude of the force of friction between unlubricated, dry surfaces sliding one over the other is
    proportional to the normal force pressing the surfaces together and is independent of the (macroscopic) area of contact
    and of the relative speed.
    </quote>
    At the microscopic level, the frictional force <m>(F_f)</m> does depend on the actual area of contact of the
    irregularities of the surfaces.  This actual area of contact then increases as the force pressing the two surfaces
    together increases, this force is called the load.  Using Newton's <m>2^{\rm nd}</m> Law in this perpendicular
    direction we can conclude that the magnitude of the load is equal to the Normal force <m>(F_N)</m> of the surface pushing on the object.
    Therefore we may write that
    <me>
    F_f \propto F_N
    \hspace{.75cm} \Rightarrow \hspace{.75cm}
    F_f = \mu F_N
    </me>
    where the Greek letter <m>\mu</m> (<q>mew</q>) is a dimensionless constant of proportionality called the coefficient of friction.</p>

    <p>When a body is pushed or pulled parallel to the surface of contact and no motion occurs,
    we can conclude that the force of the push or pull is equal to the frictional force, using Newton's <m>2^{\rm nd}</m> Law of motion.
    As the applied force is increased, the frictional force remains equal to the applied force until motion results.
    At this maximum value of the applied force, the frictional force is also a maximum and is given by
    <me>
    F_f = \mu_s F_N
    </me>
    where the subscript <m>s</m> stands for static (non-moving) friction.
    This equation can only be used at this maximum static point also called the point of impending motion.
    At the instant that the applied force becomes greater than the maximum fs, the body is set into motion
    and this motion is opposed by a frictional force called the kinetic (sliding) frictional force and is given by
    <me>
    F_f = \mu_k F_N
    </me>
    where the subscript <m>k</m> stands for the kinetic (moving) friction.
    In general, <m>\mu_k \lt \mu_s</m>; that is, it takes more force to overcome the static friction than to over come the kinetic friction.
    The coefficients of friction are generally less than one, but may be greater than one, and they depend on the nature of both surfaces.</p>


	<p>Consider a system comprised of a block on a horizontal surface being pulled horizontally by a string connected to a hanging weight.
    Assume that the system is accelerating with a constant acceleration.  Then the <m>\mu_k</m> can be solved for by the following equation:
    <me>
    \mu_k  = \frac{ mg - (M+m) a }{ Mg},
    </me>
    where <m>M</m> is the mass of the block and <m>m</m> is the hanging mass.</p>

<chapter><title>Centripetal Force</title>
<!--    Revisions \revised{Fall 2006}
        -->

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>We will be investigating the force which is necessary to maintain the circular motion of an object.
    The apparatus used will allow you to spin an F-shaped arm which has a mass suspended from the
    top arm.  This mass will be held in place by a spring which makes up the lower arm.  The spring
    will provide the centripetal force.  You will need to be familiar with the ideas of circular motion,
    centripetal versus centrifugal force, centripetal acceleration, and angular velocity.  In addition to
    these concepts, try to understand how we will measure the angular speed in lab.</p>

    <p>The centripetal acceleration <m>a_c</m> is calculated from the following equation written either
    <m>\displaystyle a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}</m>
    or
    <m>\displaystyle a_c = \omega^2 r</m>
    where <m>v</m> is the linear velocity of the particle, <m>\omega</m> is the angular velocity,
    and <m>r</m> is the radius of the circle.  Note that angular velocity is measured in radians per second. </p>

    <p>From Newton's second law, <m>\vec F = m \vec a</m>.
    Therefore, the force required to keep the particle of mass <m>m</m> moving in a circle
    with constant speed is
    <me> F = ma_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} = m\omega^2r </me>
    Recall that the centripetal force is not a force applied <em>in addition</em> to
    other existing forces.
    The centripetal force is <em>whatever combination</em> of existing force act to
    maintain circular motion.</p>

    </introduction>
    <objectives><title>Experimental Objectives</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>It is our purpose to verify the above equation experimentally by measuring the applied force
        and comparing it to the specific combination of variables expressed as either
        <m>\frac{mv^2}{r}</m> or <m>m\omega^2r</m>.</p>
    </introduction>
    </objectives>

<section><title>Pre-Lab Considerations</title>

    <p><ol>
    <li><p> Why do we say that an object moving with <em>constant speed</em> in a circular path is being accelerated? </p></li>
    <li><p> In which direction is that acceleration?  How do you know?   </p></li>
    <li><p> Is this <m>a_c</m> <q>centripetal</q> or <q>centrifugal?</q> </p></li>
    </ol>
    </p>

</section> <section><title>Procedure</title>

    <p>The centripetal force is supplied by a spring.  Since we cannot directly measure
    <q>the force exerted by the spring while it is rotating</q> while it is rotating,
    determine how we can measure <q>the force exerted by the spring during the rotation</q>
    when the spring is not rotating.</p>

    <p><ul>
    <li xml:id="i-r"><p> By means of the lab apparatus, a mass <m>m</m> can be made to rotate with a constant (and measurable)
        angular speed <m>\omega</m>.  With some practice, it is possible to adjust the speed so that the radius of the path remains constant.
        The value of the radius, <m>r</m>, is marked on the apparatus and so can be measured easily.</p></li>
    <li xml:id="i-m"><p> Measuring the mass should be an obvious task.</p></li>
    <li xml:id="i-w"><p> Measuring the angular speed <m>\omega</m> is straightforward, but may not be obvious.  To do so, consider the following:
        <ul>
        <li><p> Angular speed <m>(\omega)</m> is measured in
<quantity><unit base="radian" /><per base="second" /></quantity>.</p></li>
        <li><p> <m>\omega</m> is related to the rotational speed which is measured in
<quantity><unit base="revolution" /><per base="second" /></quantity>.</p></li>
        <li><p> There are <m>2\pi</m> radians in 1 revolution.</p></li>
        <li><p> We can count the number of revolutions.</p></li>
        <li><p> The <q>period of rotation,</q> <m>T</m>, is defined as the number of seconds per revolution.</p></li>
        <li><p> We measure the period not by timing a single revolution, but by measuring the time for multiple (20)
            revolutions divided by the number of revolutions. (This averages out any uncertainty due to reaction-time.)</p></li>
        </ul></p>
        <p> As the mass rotates, its period of rotation can be measured.
            This allows you to calculate the angular speed using the hints above.</p></li>
    <li><p> Repeat the entire procedure for a second value of r.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

</section> <section><title>Analysis</title>

    <p>From measurements of <m>m</m>, <m>\omega</m>, and <m>r</m>, calculate the theoretical centripetal force on
    the mass (which experimentally is supplied by the spring).  The (unmeasurable) amount
    of force exerted by the spring to hold the spinning mass at a particular radius is
    equal to the (measurable) force required to stretch the spring to that radius.  Experimentally determine
    the force necessary to stretch the spring to a specific radius and compare that with the amount
    of centripetal force calculated above.</p>

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Conservation laws play a very important role in our understanding of our physical world.
    For example, the law of conservation of energy can be applied in all physical processes.
    This is a fundamental and independent statement about the nature of the physical world.
    It is not necessarily derivable from other laws like Newton's Laws of motion.
    Though for simple point mass systems, the law of conservation of energy can be derived from Newton's Laws.
    It can be shown that the net work done on a system is equal to the change in the kinetic energy
    <m>(W_{\rm net} = \Delta K)</m> of the system; this is called the work-energy theorem and it can be written in a variety of forms.
    When a net positive work is done on a system, the kinetic energy of the system increases, and
    when a net negative work is done on the system (as from a friction force), the kinetic energy of the system decreases.</p>

    <p>When the gravitational force acts on a system, the work it does on the system,
    <m>W_g</m>, is the gravitational force <m>(mg)</m> times the vertical displacement <m>(h=\Delta y)</m>: <m>W_g=mg\Delta y</m>.
    For convenience, this is called the change in gravitational potential energy <m>(W_g = - \Delta P)</m>.
    <em>If</em> the gravitational force is the only force acting on the system then <m>W_g = W_{\rm net}</m> and
    therefore, <m>-\Delta P = \Delta K</m> for the system.  When a force can be associated with a potential energy,
    it is called a <q>conservative force.</q>  Another kind of potential energy deals with an elastic potential energy,
    like in a spring.  The energy stored in a spring is given by the formula <m>P_s = \frac{1}{2} k \Delta x^2</m>.</p>

    <p><em>If</em>, on the other hand, a force dissipates energy, then it is called a <q>nonconservative force</q> and
    it will have no associated potential energy.  Frictional forces are an example of a nonconservative force and the
    work done by a frictional force is negative because (physically) the frictional force removes energy from the system
    and (mathematically) the frictional force and the displacement are in opposite directions.
    This work done by friction is converted into heat or sound.
    To distinguish the energy of heat or sound from the potential and kinetic energy, we define the total mechanical energy,
    <m>E=K+P</m> at any point.  Since frictional forces remove mechanical energy, we say <m>W_f = \Delta E = \Delta K + \Delta P</m>.</p>

    <p>In general then, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed,
    but can only change from one form to another; or the total energy of the system at point A is equal to the
    total energy of the system at point B.</p>

<section><title>Procedure</title>

    <introduction>
    <p>We would like for you to verify the conservation of mechanical energy in two different situations;
    so, there are two parts to this experiment.  We will first consider a flat track with accelerated motion,
    as in the Newton's Law lab and the Friction lab.  We can then consider an inclined plane.
    You will not be given an explicit procedure, but rather you will be given a series of questions with answers
    that will imply the procedure.  Part of the experiment is for you to figure out for yourself what the best
    course of action is.  Please answer the questions as they are asked.</p>

<!--  <aside>
    <title>NOTE:</title>
        <p>There is enough analysis for this lab that you will have two weeks to complete the lab.
        During the first week, you will do the two parts of the experiment and begin to write up your report.
        During the second week, you will do some analysis and re-run the experiment to determine the cause of
        differences from expectations.  A single lab report will be due after the second week of experimentation.

    <subsection xml:id="sss-1flat"><title>Flat Track</title>

        <p>Set up the dynamics cart on a horizontal dynamics track.
        Set up the motion sensor at one end of the track and a pulley at the other end so that the pulley
        partly extends past the edge of the table.  Hang the basket over the pulley so that it can
        accelerate the cart along the track -- you might need extra weight in the cart to keep it
        from accelerating too fast.  In order to use this motion to verify the validity of the conservation
        of mechanical energy, we need to measure some variables.
        Answering <xref ref="q-1KE" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="q-1PE" text="type-global" /> will help you decide on the relevant variables.
        <xref ref="q1-2or1" text="type-global" /> should help you determine how to finish setting up the equipment.</p>

            decide if you need to <q>translate</q> the position or velocity data in order to find the specific values
            that you actually need.</p></statement>
        </exercise>

        <p>Once you decide what variables to measure, run the experiment for one set of masses while measuring the appropriate variables.
        Put the data into Excel and decide what plot(s) will allow you to verify the validity of the conservation of mechanical energy.

    <subsection xml:id="sss-1sloped"><title>Sloped Track</title>

    <p>Remove the pulley from the track.  Your cart will have either a spring-loaded <q>battering ram</q> on the front or a pair of magnets.
    If you have the battering ram, then you will want the end of the track with the rubber nub at the bottom of the incline.
    If you have the magnets, then you need to replace the pulley with a <q>C</q> shaped <q>catch-bar.</q>
    <em>Ask for help from the instructor!</em>  The catch-bar has magnets in it that will repel the magnets in the cart.
    In this case, the cart must not be going so fast as to come into physical contact with the magnets on the catch-bar.</p>

    <p>Raise one end of the dynamics track.  <xref ref="q-1slope" text="type-global" /> should help decide how tilted.
    Measure the tilt angle of the track with two methods: use a protractor, and measure the vertical rise and track length and
    calculate the tilt angle using the inverse-sine function.  Answer <xref ref="q-1anglemeasurement" text="type-global" />.
    As you continue to set up the track for measurements, consider answering <xref ref="q-1KE" text="type-global" />, <xref ref="q-1PE" text="type-global" />,
    and <xref ref="q1-2or1" text="type-global" /> again for this situation to help you decide on the appropriate accessories (sensors);
    but note <xref ref="q-1rampangle" text="type-global" /> as you think about the answers to the previous questions.</p>

        <exercise xml:id="q-1slope">
            <statement><p>  We want the cart to accelerate down the track (not too slow), but not to fly off

            Use a slope somewhere in between.</p></statement>

            Which trig function relates the distance along the ramp to the corresponding vertical distance?</p></statement>
        </exercise>

    <p>Once you decide on the variables to be measured, but before you make the measurements,
    you will need to calibrate your position measurements.  We would like zero to correspond to being at the bottom of the ramp,
    so place the cart stationary at the bottom and use the motion sensor to measure this position.
    In order to verify the validity of the conservation of mechanical energy, release the cart from rest near the top of the ramp and
    let it roll down the incline, bouncing three times before you stop the measurement.  Do this for one value of mass.

    <p>Transfer these data to Excel again and decide on the best graph to verify the objective.
    Again, <xref ref="q-1plots" text="type-global" /> may help with this; however, you will also need to consider
    <xref ref="q-1bounce" text="type-global" />.  Decide if you need a trendline and where it would be fit.

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Conservation laws play a very important role in our understanding of our physical world.
    For example, the law of conservation of energy can be applied in all physical processes.
    This is a fundamental and independent statement about the nature of the physical world.
    It is not necessarily derivable from other laws like Newton's Laws of motion.
    Though for simple point mass systems, the law of conservation of energy can be derived from Newton's Laws.
    It can be shown that the net work done on a system is equal to the change in the kinetic energy
    <m>(W_{\rm net} = \Delta K)</m> of the system; this is called the work-energy theorem and it can be written in a variety of forms.
    When a net positive work is done on a system, the kinetic energy of the system increases, and
    when a net negative work is done on the system (as from a friction force), the kinetic energy of the system decreases.</p>

    <p>When the gravitational force acts on a system, the work it does on the system,
    <m>W_g</m>, is the gravitational force <m>(mg)</m> times the vertical displacement <m>(h=\Delta y)</m>: <m>W_g=mg\Delta y</m>.
    For convenience, this is called the change in gravitational potential energy <m>(W_g = - \Delta P)</m>.
    <em>If</em> the gravitational force is the only force acting on the system then <m>W_g = W_{\rm net}</m> and
    therefore, <m>-\Delta P = \Delta K</m> for the system.  When a force can be associated with a potential energy,
    it is called a <q>conservative force.</q>  Another kind of potential energy deals with an elastic potential energy,
    like in a spring.  The energy stored in a spring is given by the formula <m>P_s = \frac{1}{2} k \Delta x^2</m>.</p>

    <p><em>If</em>, on the other hand, a force dissipates energy, then it is called a <q>nonconservative force</q> and
    it will have no associated potential energy.  Frictional forces are an example of a nonconservative force and the
    work done by a frictional force is negative because (physically) the frictional force removes energy from the system
    and (mathematically) the frictional force and the displacement are in opposite directions.
    This work done by friction is converted into heat or sound.
    To distinguish the energy of heat or sound from the potential and kinetic energy, we define the total mechanical energy,
    <m>E=K+P</m> at any point.  Since frictional forces remove mechanical energy, we say <m>W_f = \Delta E = \Delta K + \Delta P</m>.</p>

    <p>In general then, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed,
    but can only change from one form to another; or the total energy of the system at point A is equal to the
    total energy of the system at point B.</p>

    </introduction>
    <objectives><title>Experimental Objective</title>

    <introduction><p>The purpose of this experiment will be to verify the validity of the law of conservation of mechanical energy,
    that <m>\Delta E = 0</m> as a cart runs along a track.</p>
    </introduction>
    </objectives>

<section><title>Procedure</title>

    <introduction>
    <p>We would like for you to verify the conservation of mechanical energy in two different situations;
    so, there are two parts to this experiment.  We will first consider a flat track with accelerated motion,
    as in the Newton's Law lab and the Friction lab.  We can then consider an inclined plane.
    You will not be given an explicit procedure, but rather you will be given a series of questions with answers
    that will imply the procedure.  Part of the experiment is for you to figure out for yourself what the best
    course of action is.  Please answer the questions as they are asked.</p>

    <aside><title>NOTE:</title>
        <p>There is enough analysis for this lab that you will have two weeks to complete the lab.
        During the first week, you will do the two parts of the experiment and begin to write up your report.
        During the second week, you will do some analysis and re-run the experiment to determine the cause of
        differences from expectations.  A single lab report will be due after the second week of experimentation.
        </p>
    </aside>

    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="sss-flat"><title>Flat Track</title>

        <p>Set up the dynamics cart on a horizontal dynamics track.
        Set up the motion sensor at one end of the track and a pulley at the other end so that the pulley
        partly extends past the edge of the table.  Hang the basket over the pulley so that it can
        accelerate the cart along the track -- you might need extra weight in the cart to keep it
        from accelerating too fast.  In order to use this motion to verify the validity of the conservation
        of mechanical energy, we need to measure some variables.
        Answering <xref ref="q-KE" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="q-PE" text="type-global" /> will help you decide on the relevant variables.
        <xref ref="q-2or1" text="type-global" /> should help you determine how to finish setting up the equipment.</p>

        <exercise xml:id="q-KE">
            <statement><p> In order to verify <m>\Delta E=0</m>, we will need to calculate <m>E</m> as <m>E=K+P</m>.
                Therefore, we need to know the kinetic energy, <m>K=\frac{1}{2} m v^2</m>, the energy of <em>some mass</em>,
                <m>m</m>, moving at a speed <m>v</m>.  Which mass do you need to measure?  How can you measure the velocity?</p></statement>

            located some height, <m>y</m>, above the ground.  Which mass do you need to measure?

        <exercise xml:id="q-2or1">
            <statement><p> In order to measure the position of the falling mass and the velocity of the system,
            do you need two motion sensors?  Can you manage with one?  Considering that it is a fairly expensive piece of equipment,
            where should you NOT put the sonic ranger?  Where could you put it?  Depending on where you put the ranger,
            decide if you need to <q>translate</q> the position or velocity data in order to find the specific values
            that you actually need.</p></statement>
        </exercise>

        <p>Once you decide what variables to measure, run the experiment for one set of masses while measuring the appropriate variables.
        Put the data into Excel and decide what plot(s) will allow you to verify the validity of the conservation of mechanical energy.
        <xref ref="q-plots" text="type-global" /> may help with this.  Decide if you need a trendline.
        Relate the information in <xref ref="q-EKP" text="type-global" /> to the statement you are trying to verify.</p>

                    When the cart is at the bottom of the track during the motion,

                        You can calculate the elastic potential energy stored in the spring of the force transducer with

    <subsection xml:id="sss-sloped"><title>Sloped Track</title>

    <p>Remove the pulley from the track.  Your cart will have either a spring-loaded <q>battering ram</q> on the front or a pair of magnets.
    If you have the battering ram, then you will want the end of the track with the rubber nub at the bottom of the incline.
    If you have the magnets, then you need to replace the pulley with a <q>C</q> shaped <q>catch-bar.</q>
    <em>Ask for help from the instructor!</em>  The catch-bar has magnets in it that will repel the magnets in the cart.
    In this case, the cart must not be going so fast as to come into physical contact with the magnets on the catch-bar.</p>

    <p>Raise one end of the dynamics track.  <xref ref="q-slope" text="type-global" /> should help decide how tilted.
    Measure the tilt angle of the track with two methods: use a protractor, and measure the vertical rise and track length and
    calculate the tilt angle using the inverse-sine function.  Answer <xref ref="q-anglemeasurement" text="type-global" />.
    As you continue to set up the track for measurements, consider answering <xref ref="q-KE" text="type-global" />, <xref ref="q-PE" text="type-global" />,
    and <xref ref="q-2or1" text="type-global" /> again for this situation to help you decide on the appropriate accessories (sensors);
    but note <xref ref="q-rampangle" text="type-global" /> as you think about the answers to the previous questions.</p>

        <exercise xml:id="q-slope">
            <statement><p>  We want the cart to accelerate down the track (not too slow), but not to fly off
            at the bottom (not too fast).  How fast is <em>too fast</em>?  Don't use that slope!  How fast is <em>too slow</em>?
            Use a slope somewhere in between.</p></statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise xml:id="q-anglemeasurement">
            <statement><p>  After you measure the angle of incline in these two ways, consider the
            uncertainty in the measurements.  Which of these measurement is more precise?</p></statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise xml:id="q-rampangle">
            <statement><p>  The motion sensor will measure the motion of the cart <em>along</em> the ramp,

            Which trig function relates the distance along the ramp to the corresponding vertical distance?</p></statement>
        </exercise>

    <p>Once you decide on the variables to be measured, but before you make the measurements,
    you will need to calibrate your position measurements.  We would like zero to correspond to being at the bottom of the ramp,
    so place the cart stationary at the bottom and use the motion sensor to measure this position.
    In order to verify the validity of the conservation of mechanical energy, release the cart from rest near the top of the ramp and
    let it roll down the incline, bouncing three times before you stop the measurement.  Do this for one value of mass.
    Answer <xref ref="q-mass" text="type-global" />.
    </p>

        <exercise xml:id="q-mass">
            <statement><p>  Does the mass of the cart matter?
            If you run it again at a different value of mass, would you expect the overall conclusion to be different?
            Would you expect the specific values to be different?</p></statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise xml:id="q-mass2">
            <statement><p> If the mechanical energy is conserved, then
            <me> \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 + m g y_i = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2 + m g y_f </me>
            What do you notice about the mass?  Is your graph different if the mass of the cart changes?
            Does this support or conflict with the idea that the total mechanical energy is conserved?
            On the other hand, if the mechanical energy is not conserved, then
            <me> W_{\rm nc} = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2 + m g y_f - \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 - m g y_i</me>
            What do you notice about the mass now?
            Does your graph support or conflict with the idea that the total mechanical energy is conserved?</p></statement>
        </exercise>

    <p>Transfer these data to Excel again and decide on the best graph to verify the objective.
    Again, <xref ref="q-plots" text="type-global" /> may help with this; however, you will also need to consider
    <xref ref="q-bounce" text="type-global" />.  Decide if you need a trendline and where it would be fit.

</section> <section><title>Analysis</title>

    <p>
    For the second week, you should already have your graphs from the experiment and you should have written a
    significant portion of the theory and the analysis.
    We are now going to take a closer look at the irregularities of the data and investigate some variations to try to
    explain what those data say.
    <ul>
    <li><p> One of the factors you were asked to consider last week was <xref ref="q-mass" text="type-global" />.
        In order to verify this, re-run <xref ref="sss-flat" text="type-global" /> with a noticeably different massed cart.
        Re-create the graph and use this only to note the effect of a different mass.  Answer <xref ref="q-mass2" text="type-global" />.
        </p></li>
    <li><p> Before drawing conclusions about the validity of the conservation of mechanical energy,
        consider <xref ref="q-missing" text="type-global" />. </p></li>

    <li><exercise xml:id="q-missing">
            <statement><p> We need to look for the energy lost in each graph.
            <ol>
                <li><p> When you look at the graph from <xref ref="sss-flat" text="type-global" /> for <m>E</m>,
                    is the energy conserved or is there energy lost?
                    If lost, calculate the energy lost or gained from the graph. (It might help to have a trendline.)
                    If energy is lost, come up with at least two explanations for where this energy goes.</p></li>
                <li><p> When you look at the graph from <xref ref="sss-sloped" text="type-global" /> for <m>E</m>, there are jumps in the energy.  Why?
                    <ol>
                    <li><p> What is happening between the jumps?  Does <xref ref="sss-flat" text="type-global" /> help to
                        explain these sections of the graph?
                        Compared to the jumps, can we assume that the mechanical energy is conserved between the jumps?</p></li>
                    <li><p> What is happening at the time of those <q>jumps</q>?
                        From the trend of the graph, calculate the amount of energy lost during each sudden change,
                        call it the energy discrepancy, and the percent of this discrepancy relative to the total energy
                        before the corresponding collision.   Discuss where this <q>missing</q> energy goes.
                        Is the ratio of <q>energy discrepancy</q> to total prior energy the same for each jump?</p></li>
                    </ol></p></li>
                <li><p> Comment in general, on the law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy.
                    Can you predict any effects that might invalidate the conservation of mechanical energy?
                    Can these effects be minimized?  Is it possible to run the experiment again minimizing this effect?</p></li>
            </ol></p></statement>
        </exercise>
        </li>
    <li><p> As you evaluate <xref ref="sss-sloped" text="type-global" />, you might be asked to re-run the experiment with a force transducer
        placed at the bottom of the track.  (This should imply where the motion sensor will go.)
        Make sure that the cart will bounce from the force sensor. Make sure that the force sensor is zeroed before the start.
        There might be some information here based on work as a force-through-a-distance versus work as a change-in-energy.
        </p></li>
    <li><p> One explanation of a loss of energy (non-conservation) is friction.
        List all of the places where two pieces of material rub against each other.
        Since <m>F_f = \mu F_N</m>, do any of these locations have a normal force that can be varied?
        (Recall <xref ref="q-mass" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="q-mass2" text="type-global" />.)
        <!-- (Note <xref ref="q-mass2" text="type-global" />.) -->
        As an independent measure of the amount of friction, we can also consider the actual acceleration versus the expected acceleration.
        <xref ref="q-accel" text="type-global" /> will help you determine the expected acceleration and the variable necessary to find it.
        <xref ref="q-fracc" text="type-global" /> will help decide on the relationship between the friction and the acceleration.
        </p></li>

    <li><exercise xml:id="q-accel">
            <statement><p> Given an ramp inclined at some angle <m>\theta</m>,
                what is the component of the gravitational force aimed down the ramp?
                Assuming that there is no friction, what is the net force?  Since <m>F_{\rm net} = m a</m>,
                the acceleration should be <ellipsis /> ?<fn><m>a=g \sin\theta</m>.</fn>
                From your expression, what do you need to measure in order to find the expected value of <m>a</m>?

            <statement><p> If there is friction, then how do you expect the actual acceleration to

                So, how would you interpret finding an acceleration that is exactly equal to the expected value?
                less than the expected value?  Larger than the expected value?</p></statement>
        </exercise></li>
    <li><p> A second explanation for the loss of energy is that some component is gaining rotational kinetic energy.
        The formula for this is <m>K_R = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2</m>, where <m>I</m> is the moment of
        inertia<fn>In this case, the moment of inertia is probably a little less than <m>\frac{1}{2} m r^2</m>,
            where <m>m</m> is the mass of the rotating object and <m>r</m> is the radius of the rotating object.
            This is not a convenient way to calculate <m>I</m> at this time.</fn>,
        and <m>\omega</m> is the angular speed <m>\omega = v/r</m>.
        Assuming that any discrepancy that you found in the conservation of energy is due to the rotational kinetic energy of the pulley,
        how much energy would the pulley need to have at the end of the run (while spinning full speed)?
        Based on the final velocity of the cart, what is the angular speed of the pulley?
        Based on these numbers, <m>K_R</m> and <m>\omega</m>, what is the moment of inertia for the pulley?
        Can you tell if this is a reasonable estimate?</p></li>

        \revised{Sep 1, 2008}
        -->

<introduction>
    <p>The most important part of doing science is the peer-review process.
    After one completes a research project, the report is submitted for publication.
    The publisher has a number of reviewer (usually made up of respected authors) and
    the submission is sent to two (sometimes three) reviewers who advise the publisher on the merits of the work.
    Once you make a submission, it might be two months before the reviewers finish reviewing the work.
    Generally the publisher will return the reviewers' comments to the author.
    If all reviewers agree that the paper is viable, then the publisher accepts it.
    If they agree not to accept a paper, then it is rejected.
    If the reviewers are split, then the decision is at the discretion of the publisher.
    In most cases, the reviewer makes suggestions for how to improve the paper or where to clarify the discussion.
    In some cases, the author must either significantly revise the entire project or make an argument
    why the reviewer is either mistaken or is merely pointing out the specific point-of-contention that
    the author was intending to spark in the readers.  In most cases, the process of an accepted paper is
    <ol>
        <li xml:id="i-submit"><p> Author submits article.</p></li>
        <li xml:id="i-review"><p> Publishers submit to reviewers, who read and return comments to the publisher.</p></li>
        <li><p> Publisher gives author a chance to respond; most do (!).</p></li>
        <li><p> Publishers provide authors' response to reviewers, who then give final approval (or not).</p></li>
        <li><p> Paper goes to Editor, who returns paper to author for grammar, spelling, and formatting corrections.</p></li>
        <li><p> After the author fixes or refuses to fix the editor's <q>suggestions,</q> the paper goes to publication.</p></li>
    </ol>
    This process can take anywhere from 1-2 months to a year and a half.  This week, we will do <xref ref="i-submit" text="type-global" />.
    Next week, we will do <xref ref="i-review" text="type-global" />.</p>

    <p>Usually during the review process, the reviewer is not informed of the name of the submission author --
    to minimize influencing the reviewer.  Similarly, the names of the reviewers are not revealed to the submission author.
    This is called <q>double-blind review.</q>  Some disciplines are specialized enough that all of the active
    researchers are familiar with each other's work.  In those cases, it is possible to guess who an author is
    (based on the approach to the project) or to guess who the reviewer is (based on the style of comments).
    In principle, both sides are civil in their comments and reactions because they are members of the same community
    and see each other annually at the topic meetings.  Researchers are competitors and collaborators who only progress
    by working off of each others' ideas.</p>

    </introduction>
    <section><title>The Assignment</title>

    <p>In order to manage the double-blind review process, before you leave lab today you will all turn in your
    (personally selected) code name.  Do not tell anybody what you selected and do not use a nickname that is easily
    recognizable by others -- the point of a secret identity is to keep the secret!</p>

    <p>In this week's lab, one lab section will do <xref ref="s-Hooke" text="title" /> and the other lab section will do
    <xref ref="s-Pendulum" text="title" />.  The underlying ideas are similar to each other and will help you next week when you
    review an article submitted by a colleague who did the other experiment.  When you submit your lab this week,
    you will submit your notebook and two (almost identical) copies of your report.  One copy will have your name
    <em>and</em> your secret code name.  The other copy will have <em>only</em> your secret identity.</p>

<chapter xml:id="s-Hooke"><title>Hooke's Law and Simple Harmonic Motion</title> <!-- Revisions \revised{(Aug 27, 2012)} -->

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Oscillatory motion is one of the most common types of motions and can occur in any physical system.
    Mechanical systems can experience a periodic motion, and then will vibrate at a natural frequency.
    This phenomenon is called resonance.  Sound is a vibration in the air, which we hear with our ears;
    light is an oscillation of electric and magnetic fields, which we can see.  The atoms and molecules in
    all objects are in a state of continual vibration, which we can detect as the temperature of the object,
    and the atomic vibrations of a quartz crystal can be used as a very accurate timer.  The study of
    repetitive motion is not just an intellectual exercise, but actually enables us to model complicated
    systems with simple harmonic motion.</p>

    <p>In this lab, we will consider spring as an example of oscillation.  This oscillation is due to the
    elasticity of a spring.  We will need to measure the stiffness of the spring and relate this to the rate of oscillation.</p>

    <p>Most systems have elastic properties, such that when the system is deformed or vibrated,
    there is a force which tries to restore the system to its original state.  If the restoring
    force is proportional to the displacement from its equilibrium position, then the object is
    said to be in simple harmonic motion (SHM).  A linear restoring force can be expressed
    mathematically by the equation
    <men xml:id="eq-hooke">
    \vec F= -k\vec x \hspace{.5cm} \mbox{or as} \hspace{.5cm}  a= \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\frac{kx}{m}
    </men>
    where <m>F</m> is the restoring force, <m>x</m> is the displacement from the equilibrium position
    (or zero position), <m>k</m> is a proportionality constant, and the minus sign indicates that the
    restoring force is always opposite the direction of the displacement.  For a spring system, <m>k</m>
    is called the spring constant, and represents the ratio of the applied force to the elongation.
    The spring constant is an inherent physical property of the spring itself (an elastic property).
    The value of <m>k</m> gives a relative indication of the stiffness of the spring.  If the spring
    system is in equilibrium  <m>(\sum F_i =0)</m>  then the restoring force is equal to the force
    pulling on the spring, and this force is proportional to the extension of the spring from its equilibrium
    position.  This relationship for elastic behavior is known as Hooke's Law, after Robert Hooke (1635-1703).
    </p>

<!-- <p>Notice that for the previous equation to be valid,  the acceleration must have the same functional form as the displacement.
    One function for which this would be true is the cosine function, that is, that both the acceleration and the displacement
    can be represented by cosine functions.</p>
    -->

    <p>Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) systems can
    <!-- therefore -->
    be described by harmonic functions (cosines), where the displacement as a function of the time <m>x(t)</m> can be written as
    <me>	x(t) = A \cos(2\pi f t) </me>
    where <m>A</m> is the amplitude of the motion, and <m>f</m> is the frequency of the motion in units of cycles per second
    <m>(\mathrm{sec}^{-1})</m> commonly called a hertz (Hz) after Heinrich Hertz.
    The period (<m>T</m>, in units of seconds per cycle) equals the inverse of the frequency <m>(f)</m>,
    <m>T=\phantom{1}^1\!\!/_f</m>.  For a mass on a spring, the period <m>T</m> depends on the physical parameters of the system
    (the mass, and the spring constant), and can be given by
    <men xml:id="eq-hookeperiod"> T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} </men>
    </p>

    <introduction>
    <p>Notice that <xref ref="eq-hooke" text="type-global">Equation</xref> depends not only on the spring constant,
    but also on the acceleration (due to gravity, <m>g)</m>.  On the other hand, <xref ref="eq-hookeperiod" text="type-global">Equation</xref>
    only depends on <m>k</m>.  You may also recall that when you measured <m>g</m> in a previous lab,
    you did not measure it to be <m>9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2}</m>.  We would like our measurement of <m>k</m> to not depend on <m>g</m>.</p>

    <p>Because of these two aspects of springs [elasticity, shown by <xref ref="eq-hooke" text="type-global">Equation</xref>, and periodicity
    shown by <xref ref="eq-hookeperiod" text="type-global">Equation</xref>], we can investigate both the elasticity of a spring, and use the
    oscillations to measure <m>g</m> indirectly.

    </p>

</section> <section><title>Procedure</title>

    <subsection xml:id="sss-hooke"><title></title>Hooke's law}

        <p>We will first measure the elasticity of the spring, using <xref ref="eq-hooke" text="type-global">Equation</xref>.
        <ul>
            <li><p> With the available spring, attach it rigidly and hang it vertically against the Dynamics Track.
                Hang various masses and measure the elongation of the spring, to a maximum of 60 cm.
                Do not over stretch the spring.  Record the bottom end of the mass hanger for the initial reference position.
                If a tapered spring is used, the small end should be at the top.</p></li>
            <li><p> Measure the elongation both when the masses are added and then when they are removed.
                Perfectly elastic objects (possibly your spring) will return to the exact same location when pulled
                with the same force whether they are being stretched out or being allowed to relax back after stretching.</p></li>
            <li><p> You will be graphing the relationship between the mass and the displacement.</p></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="sss-bounce"><title>Oscillating Spring</title>

    <p>We will next consider the periodicity of an oscillating spring.
    <ul>
        <li><p> With the same range of masses as in <xref ref="sss-hooke" text="type-global" />,  measure the period of oscillation for each mass.
        You <em>can</em> but do not <em>have to</em> use the same values of mass, as long as the set of masses sampled are in the same range.
        </p></li>
        <li><p> You will be graphing the relationship between the mass and the period.
            I recommend using <m>T/(2\pi)</m> as the variable representing the period
            (because it gives nice results for the graphical parameters -- slope and intercept).
        </p></li>
        <li><p> Advice: Keep the amplitude of vibration small,  because there is a small but measurable effect
            with the period as a function of the amplitude.

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li><p> Graph both data sets (<xref ref="sss-hooke" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="sss-bounce" text="type-global" />)
            in such a way that the spring constant can be determined graphically (from a linear fit model).
        <ul>
            <li><p> When you graph the relationship between the mass and the displacement, recall that <xref ref="eq-hooke" text="type-global">Equation</xref>
                depends on two specific variables.</p></li>
            <li><p> When you graph the relationship between the mass and the period, recall that <xref ref="eq-hookeperiod" text="type-global">Equation</xref>
                depends on one specific variable.</p></li>
            <li><p> With some effort, you should be able to recognize the units of the slope and intercept and find the relevant values.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </p></li>
        <li><p> Physically interpret the meaning and value for the slopes, and the x and y intercepts for both graphs.</p></li>
        <li><p> Calculate the spring constant for both data sets, using a linear regression method.</p></li>
        <li><p> So far in the analysis, the mass of the spring has been neglected.  How would including the spring mass
            (or a partial <percent />) affect the slopes or intercepts of the two graphs?
            For the period graph one would expect to get a zero period with a zero mass.  Why?  What was your observation for the  y-intercept?
            If the data was modified by adding a constant amount of mass to each mass value  (say 1/3 the mass of the spring)
            and then re-compute the linear regression, then  what happens to the slope and intercept values?
            And do you get a higher linear correlation coefficient?</p></li>
        <li><p> If you assume a value for <m>g</m>, then both graphs will give you <m>k</m>.
            Compare the precision for these two methods.</p></li>
        <li><p> If you do not assume a value for <m>g</m>, then you can use one graph to find <m>k</m> and
            use this calculated value and the other graph to compute <m>g</m>.  How does this value of <m>g</m> compare to
            your expectations?</p></li>
        <li><p> Compare the elongations when the masses were added and then removed.  Explain any differences.</p></li>

<chapter xml:id="s-Pendulum"><title>The Simple Pendulum</title> <!-- Revisions \revised{(Aug 27, 2012)} -->

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>A simple pendulum consists of a small bob of mass <m>(m)</m> suspended by a light
    (assumed to be massless) string of length <m>(L)</m>, and the string is firmly attached at its upper end.
    This pendulum is a mechanical system which we will assume exhibits simple harmonic motion.
    That is, the restoring force on the pendulum is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position.</p>

    <p>Oscillatory motion is one of the most common types of motions and can occur in any physical system.
    Mechanical systems can experience a periodic motion, and then will vibrate at a natural frequency.
    This phenomenon is called resonance.  Sound is a vibration in the air, which we hear with our ears;
    light is an oscillation of electric and magnetic fields, which we can see.  The atoms and molecules in
    all objects are in a state of continual vibration, which we can detect as the temperature of the object,
    and the atomic vibrations of a quartz crystal can be used as a very accurate timer.  The study of
    repetitive motion is not just an intellectual exercise, but actually enables us to model complicated
    systems with simple harmonic motion.</p>

    <p>Galileo (1564-1642) investigated the natural motions of a simple pendulum.  From his observations he
    concluded that <q>vibrations of very large and very small amplitude all occupy the same time.</q>
    Galileo's time interval of measurement was his own pulse rate.  With today's modern technology we have
    much more precise measuring instruments.   This experiment will investigate the relationships between
    the physical characteristics of the pendulum and the period of the pendulum.</p>

</introduction>
    <objectives><title>Experimental Objectives</title>

    <ul>
        <li><p> Determine the relationship between the period of the pendulum and its amplitude.</p></li>
        <li><p> Determine the relationship between the period of the pendulum and its mass.</p></li>
        <li><p> Determine the relationship between the period of the pendulum and the length of the pendulum.</p></li>
        <li><p> Use a graphical analysis to investigate these relationships, and from the best linear graph

        <li><p> Gravity also plays a part in this experiment, so include gravity into your empirical equation,
            and use unit analysis to help figure out this relationship.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    </introduction>
    </objectives>

<section><title>Procedure</title>

    <p>You will have available for your use:  pendulum bobs, string, timers, and a protractor.
    Be careful to fix the string to a point of support which will not move or vibrate as the pendulum swings.
    You will test each of the three relationships above (period vs amplitude, vs mass, and vs length).
    While measuring one relationship, you should ensure that -- if they matter -- then the other two variables are not varied.
    For example, when changing the pendulum mass do not vary the pendulum's length or its amplitude.</p>

    <p>Some considerations while doing this lab:
    <ul>
        <li><p> The amplitude of oscillation is the maximum angle which the string makes with the vertical.</p></li>
        <li><p> In general when testing the mass or the length, it is best to keep the amplitude of oscillation small.</p></li>
        <li><p> When testing any of the relationships, you should measure a few widely-separated values.  If these seem to vary
            significantly, then fill in the gaps between those measurements to make a reliable graph.
            See <xref ref="q-howmany" text="type-global" />.</p></li>
        <li><p> If you can prove that the period is not affected by one of these variables, then you do not need to worry about
            keeping it constant while you measure the other variables.</p></li>
        <li><p> Your graphical analysis will be better if your graph is linear.  Consider <xref ref="q-linpend" text="type-global" /> for advice on
            making your graphs.</p></li>

<chapter><title>Ballistic Pendulum</title> <!-- Revisions \revised{(Jack)} -->


<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Conservation laws will again play a significant part in this ballistic pendulum experiment.
    A ballistic pendulum is a devise which has a cavity in the pendulum bob, and a small ball will be
    fired into and captured in this cavity.  When this happens, the initially stationary pendulum will
    swing about the pendulum's point of support.  During this collision between the ball and the
    pendulum, the momentum of the total system should be conserved from the instant just prior, to the
    instant just after the collision.  Physicist's hold true a general conservation law for momentum
    which applies in all interactions of two or more objects where there are no other outside forces
    acting on the system.  For collisions on the earth, the force of gravity is an outside force but
    momentum is still considered to be conserved if the time of the interaction is small.</p>

    <p>The collision in this experiment is called a totally inelastic collision because after the
    collision the two objects are held together, they move together with a single velocity, and the
    kinetic energy of the system is not conserved during the collision.  Using the general
    conservation of momentum law for the collision described an equation can be written for the
    initial velocity of the ball in terms of the velocity of the system at the instant after the
    collision and the individual masses of the ball and the pendulum.  After the collision the
    pendulum and ball will swing and at the highest point in the swing they will be caught.  The
    KE of the system at the instant after the collision is converted totally to PE at the highest
    point in the swing.  The velocity of the system at the instant after the collision can then be
    determined using the law of conservation of energy.  Then with these two conservation laws, the
    initial velocity of the ball can be determined.</p>

    <p>The initial velocity of the ball can also be determined by firing the ball horizontally
    off the edge of the table and analyzing the 2-dimensional projectile motion of  the ball moving
    under the influence of the gravitational force. This analysis involves separating the motion
    into its component directions, using the standard kinematic equations of motion and an
    appropriate set of measurements.</p>

    <p>For these two very different techniques calculate the same initial velocity of the projectile.
    An analysis and comparison of the two methods will help to illustrate the interconnections between
    these physics topics.</p>

    </introduction>
    <objectives><title>Experimental Objectives</title>

    <introduction><p>To determine the initial velocity of the ballistic projectile from two different sets of experimental measurements,
    1) the range and vertical height measurements of the projectile motion, and
    2) through the use of the ballistic pendulum.</p>
    </introduction>
    </objectives>

<section><title>Pre-Lab Considerations</title>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li><p> Draw before and after pictures for a totally inelastic collision between two masses,  <m>m_1</m> and <m>M_2</m>.
            Assume that <m>M_2</m> is initially stationary, and that <m>m_1</m> is initially moving horizontally
            with a velocity of  <m>v</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p> For this collision, write out the conservation of momentum equation.  Solve for the shared
            velocity of the pair after the collision.</p></li>
        <li><p> After the collision, the pendulum and ball will swing.  The KE of the pair at the instant
            after the collision will be converted to PE as it swings.  Write out a conservation of energy
            equation for this process, in terms of the mass of the pendulum and ball, the change in height of
            the system and the velocity of the system at the instant after the collision.</p></li>
        <li><p> Combine these two conservation laws to derive an expression for the initial velocity of the
            ball (before the collision) to the final height of the ball and pendulum system.</p></li>
        <li><p> Draw a picture of the ball's path when  fired horizontally off of a table.
            Draw the ball in its initial position (at the moment it begins its free fall), and in its final
            position (at the moment just before it hits the floor).   Make the ball larger than its scale
            size so that it size can be easily seen in your picture.  On the picture label the height and
            the range of the projectile.  Think about whether the measurements should be taken from the top,
            bottom or the middle of the ball.  What part of the ball will hit the floor?  Think about this
            for both the horizontal and the vertical measurements.</p></li>
        <li><p> For this projectile motion, use the kinematic equations of motion to derive an equation for
            the initial velocity of the ball in terms of the height and range measurements.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li><p> Set-up the ballistic spring gun so that it will fire the projectile ball horizontally off
            the edge of the table.  Use a bubble level or the ball itself to make sure that the gun is level.
            Move the pendulum out of the way.  Clamp the apparatus to the table, and use cardboard pads.
            The initial velocity of the projectile can be changed by adjusting the spring tension.</p></li>
        <li><p> Tape a piece of paper to the floor where the ball will land, then tape a sheet of carbon paper at this spot.</p></li>
        <li><p> Be careful not to hit anything or anybody with the ballistic projectile!   Use larger pads or
        boxes to protect the tables and the walls.</p></li>
        <li><p> Repeat the experiment for a sufficient number of trials (15-20), and calculate a standard deviation of the range.</p></li>
        <li><p> Calculate the initial velocity (and uncertainty) of the projectile after taking the appropriate measurements.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <subsection><title>The Ballistic Pendulum</title>

    <p>The ballistic pendulum apparatus consists of three parts:
    1) a ballistic spring-loaded gun for the firing of the projectile,
    2) a hollow pendulum bob suspended by a light rod for catching the fired projectile, and
    3) an angled platform for catching the pendulum bob at the highest position of the bob's swing.</p>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li><p> When removing the ball from the pendulum, be sure to push up on the spring catch  in the
            pendulum so as to not to damage the pendulum.</p></li>
        <li><p> The pointer on the side of the pendulum indicates the position of the center of mass of the system.</p></li>
        <li><p> Do not try to take the apparatus apart, the instructor will give you the mass of the pendulum.</p></li>
        <li><p> Clamp the base to the table, so that there is no relative motion of the base.</p></li>
        <li><p> Fire the ball into the pendulum bob and mark the final notch position of the pendulum.</p></li>
        <li><p> Repeat the experiment with a sufficient number of trials (15) so that a standard
            deviation of the notch positions can be obtained.</p></li>
        <li><p> Measure the change in height of the pendulum's pointer from its initial position to the
            average notch position.  Calculate the uncertainty in this distance.</p></li>

<chapter><title>Conditions of Equilibrium -- Model of a Human Forearm</title> <!-- Revisions \revised{(Nov 22, 2011)} \revised{(Aug 18, 2011)} -->

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Objects that are not accelerating are said to be in a state of equilibrium.  If the object is
    moving at a constant velocity, then it is in equilibrium.  If the object is at rest, then it is in
    <q>static equilibrium.</q>  These principles apply to many physical examples in engineering,
    architecture, and biophysics.   In particular, these principles allow one to be able to analyze and
    calculate the forces on the beams or the cables in a bridge or the forces at work in the muscles and
    bones in the human body.</p>

    <p>The two conditions for equilibrium can be stated in equation form: First, if the body's center of
    mass is in translational equilibrium then it will not accelerate in any direction.
    <me> \sum \vec F = 0 </me>
    Secondly, if the body is in rotational equilibrium then it will not rotate about any point or axis of rotation.
    <me> \sum \tau = 0</me>
    </p>

    <p>For all systems such as these there is a special point called the center of mass or center of
    gravity of the system.  The center of mass calculation is a weighted average of the individual masses
    (giving more emphasis to those positions where there is more mass).  The location of this special point
    can be useful in determining whether the system will be in equilibrium.  For an object with uniform
    density, such as a half-meter stick, the center of mass is at the center of the stick.</p>

</section> <section><title>Procedure</title>

    <subsection><title>Determine the Spring Constant of the Bicep Muscle</title>

    <p>Before creating the forearm model, we need an equation for the force that the bicep exerts.
    Since the spring models the bicep, we can use Hooke's law: <m>F = k(x-x_0)</m>, where <m>x_0</m>
    is the equilibrium position.  To find the force as a function of position, <m>F(x) = k x + b</m>,
    you will make two measurements of position and force and then determine the spring constant
    <m>k</m> and the intercept <m>b</m>.
    <ul>
    <li><p> Hang the spring from the vertical support so that it is easy to measure the position of the bottom of the spring.</p></li>
    <li><p> Measure the position of the bottom hook of the spring, <m>x_1</m>, with about <m>m_1=250\unit{g}</m> placed on the spring.
        Measure the position of the bottom hook of the spring, <m>x_2</m>, with about <m>m_2=850\unit{g}</m> placed on the spring.
        (If you measure from the floor, which is more convenient, then <m>k</m> will be negative.)
        <ul>
        <li><p> Parallax errors can be very significant with this measurement.  With the use of a mirror, this error can be reduced.
            Hold the mirror vertically along the track and align your line of sight until the bottom hook of the spring and its mirror
            image are at the same level.  Then take the position readings.</p></li>
        <li><p> Each person in the group should carry out these measurements without looking at the other group members' results.
            The average of these locations should be used.</p></li>
        </ul></p></li>
    <li><p> With these two measurements, calculate the spring constant <m>k</m> as the slope of the graph of <m>F</m> versus <m>x</m>.
        You do not have to -- and should not -- actually create a graph of <m>F</m> versus <m>x</m> to do this,
        <em>if</em> you remember your prelab work for slope.
        <ul>
        <!-- <li><p> <m>A</m> is the slope and can be found from <m>\displaystyle \frac{m_2-m_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>.</p></li> -->
            <li><p> <m>b</m> is the intercept.  Using one pair of data and your knowledge of <m>k</m>, find <m>b</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p> Determine the uncertainty in <m>k</m> and <m>b</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p> Now, with values and uncertainties for <m>k</m> and <m>b</m>, you can use <m>F=kx+b</m> to
                find the force that the spring thinks it is supporting.</p></li>
        </ul></p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>


<!-- <p>We can use a new version of Hooke's law to calculate the amount of force that the spring exerts by measuring the
    stretch of the spring (rather than by measuring the actual force).
    <ul>
    <li><p> Measure the position of the bottom hook of the spring, <m>x_1</m>, with about <m>m_1=250\unit{g}</m> placed on the spring.  Measure the position of the bottom hook of the spring, <m>x_2</m>, with <m>m_2=850\unit{g}</m> placed on the spring.
        <ul>
        <li><p> Parallax errors can be very significant with this measurement.  With the use of a mirror, this error can be reduced.  Hold the mirror vertically along the track and align your line of sight until the bottom hook of the spring and its mirror image are at the same level.  Then take the position readings.
        </p></li> <li><p> Each person in the group should carry out these measurements without looking at the other group members' results.  The average of these locations should be used.
        </p></li> </ul>
    </p></li> <li><p> With these two measurements, we can create an equation<fn>The equation is easier to calculate when you compare mass to position; but, it is easier to understand if you compare the weight (force on the spring) versus the position.  The equation above relates the position to the <em>mass</em>.</fn> that calculates the mass on the spring from the stretch of the spring:  <m>m(x) = A x + B</m>. Remember your prelab work for slope.
        <ul>
        <li><p> <m>A</m> is the slope and can be found from <m>\displaystyle \frac{m_2-m_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>.
        </p></li> <li><p> <m>B</m> is the intercept.  Using one pair of data, <m>m_1 = A x_1 +B</m>, solve this for <m>B</m>.
        </p></li> <li><p> Now, with values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, you can use <m>m=Ax+B</m> to find the mass that the spring thinks it is supporting, <m>m</m>, from the location, <m>x</m>, of the spring when stretched.
        </p></li> </ul>
    </p></li> </ul>

    <subsection xml:id="ss-setup"><title>Experimental Setup for the Equilibrium Experiment</title>

    <p>For our purposes, the forearm can be considered to jut out forwards from a vertical upper arm with the
    hand and the weight of the forearm itself pulling down while the bicep holds the forearm up.
    The elbow joint is assumed to be a nearly frictionless pivot point for the forearm, allowing the
    forearm to rotate about the elbow.  The upper arm (the humerus) is connected to the forearm (the ulna)
    at the elbow, exerting a downward force on the forearm at the joint.</p>

    <p>You are going to do the following procedure for two different locations of the bicep muscle:
    First set the bicep, as mentioned above, in the human location of about <m>4\unit{cm}</m> from the elbow.
    Second, set the bicep at about <m>10\unit{cm}</m> from the elbow.  You should consider which location
    gives more leverage to lift the hand.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p> With your model completely set up, place a <m>50 \unit{g}</m> mass in the <q>hand.</q>
            <em>Experimentally</em> determine the force at the elbow necessary to balance the system and make it horizontal.
            You may also change the position of the hand by small amounts if you find it easier to balance the system.
            However, be sure to record the correct distances.</p></li>
        <li><p> To check that the system is level, use another meter stick to measure the height from the floor
            <em>at each end</em> of the forearm half-meter stick.</p></li>
        <li><p> Determine the force in the bicep muscle using the formula derived in the previous section as
            appropriate for the new position of the bottom of the hook of the spring (again using the mirror for accuracy).
            Be sure to include the uncertainties!</p></li>
        <li><p> Record all force locations as read directly from the <q>forearm</q> meter stick.
            <em>Do not subtract in your head</em> so that we can reproduce the locations later, if need be.</p></li>
        <li><p> <em>Experimentally</em> determine the sensitivity of your values for force at the elbow by
            checking how many grams can be added or removed at the elbow while maintaining the horizontal equilibrium.</p></li>
        <li><p> Since the hand is so sensitive, you should estimate roughly the sensitivity of the value of force at the hand.</p></li>

    <paragraphs><title>Procedure</title>
    <p>You will be given many animal skulls.  Measure some dimension that can be measured on all skulls.
    Verify graphically (make the plot of mass versus your measured dimension) if this measurement can be
    reliably correlated to the mass of the skull.  We will assume that the mass of the skull is directly
    proportional to the overall size of the animal.  This technique allows mammalogists to gauge the size
    of animals when they can only find partial skeletons.</p>
    </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs><title>Analysis</title>
    <p>When you fit this data with a trendline, the relationship might be the familiar linear relationship,
    or it might instead be something else.  Some possibilities are:
    <ul>
        <li><p> Linear <m>\displaystyle y=mx+b</m>. In this case, you should plot the skull mass versus
            your measurement, determine the slope and intercept and the relevant regression data.
            Discuss why the intercept might have the value that it does.</p></li>
        <li><p> Geometric <m>\displaystyle y = a x^b</m>, where the coefficient <m>a</m> and
            the exponent <m>b</m> are to be determined.  In general, it is useful to fit your data this way first.
            If you find <m>b</m> is close to an integer, then try a second fit with the appropriate polynomial.
            For example, if <m>b\approx 1</m> then use a linear fit.</p></li>
        <li><p> Exponential <m>\displaystyle y = a e^{bx}</m>, where the coefficient <m>a</m> and the
            base <m>b</m> are to be determined.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Excel can fit to any of these and provide you with the equation for the trendline.
    However, Excel cannot provide the uncertainties unless the graph is linear.
    If one uses logarithms, then we can make a power-fit trendline or an exponential-fit
    trendline plot as a line so that Excel can provide the slope and intercepts with
    uncertainties.  This will allow us to create a reliable mathematical relationship
    between the variables.  In general, it is true that linear regression is significantly
    easier than a general functional regression.</p>

    <sidebyside widths="47% 47%">
        <p>If your power fit is better then we can apply the logarithm to the geometric relation:
        <md>
            <mrow> \ln y &amp; = \ln\left( a x^b \right) </mrow>
            <mrow> \ln y &amp; = \ln a + \ln x^b </mrow>
            <mrow> \ln y &amp; = \ln a + b \ln x </mrow>
            <mrow> \ln y &amp; = \left[ b \right] \ln x + \left[  \ln a \right]</mrow>
        </md>
        In this case, it is useful to make a <q>log-log plot</q> of <m>\ln y</m> versus <m>\ln x</m>,
        which should be a straight line.  The slope of the log-log relation is <m>b</m>, the exponent,
        and the intercept of the log-log relation is <m>\ln a</m>, so that <m>e^{(\ln a)}=a</m> the coefficient.</p>

        <p>If your exponential fit is better then we can apply the logarithm to the exponential relation:
        <md>
            <mrow> \ln y &amp; = \ln\left( a e^{bx} \right) </mrow>
            <mrow> \ln y &amp; = \ln a + \ln \left( e^{bx} \right) </mrow>
            <mrow> \ln y &amp; = \ln a + bx \ln \left( e \right) </mrow>
            <mrow> \ln y &amp; = \left[ b \ln e \right] x + \left[ \ln a \right] </mrow>
        </md>
        In this case, it is useful to make a <q>semi-log plot</q> of <m>\ln y</m> versus <m>x</m>,
        which should be a straight line.  The slope of the semi-log relation is <m>b</m> (because
        <m>\ln e = 1)</m> and the intercept of the semi-log relation is <m>\ln a</m>, so that
        <m>e^{(\ln a)}=a</m> the coefficient.</p>
    </sidebyside>

    <p>In biological relationships, it is common to find an exponential relationship with a base of
    <m>e=2.717182\cdots</m>; this is why we find it useful to use the <q>natural logarithm.</q></p>

    <p>Once you determine if you have an exponential or a geometric relationship, decide if there
    are any <q>outliers,</q> which animals those are, and justify why those data points might
    reasonably be excluded.  Re-fit the data after excluding the outliers.</p>

<appendix xml:id="uncertainties"> <title>Managing Uncertainties</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>One of the fundamental aspects of science is knowing the reliability of results.
        The mechanism for gaining this knowledge is first to gauge how well one knows any given measurement
        and then to propogate this to an indication of the reliability of the results that depend on those
        measurements.  The primary goal in attending to the propogation of the uncertainty is that it allows
        scientists to determine which measurement is causing the most uncertainty in the result so that
        future experimenters know which measurement to improve to get an improved result.</p>

        <p>In this section we will learn the terminology, determine how to gauge the measurement uncertainty,
        learn how to propogate this information through a calculation, and learn how to discuss this analysis
        in your lab reports.</p>

        <title>Experimental Uncertainties, Defining <q>Error</q></title>

            <p>Measurements are never exact.  For example, if one apple is divided among three people,
            your calculator will tell you that each person has <m>0.3333333333</m> of an apple.
            A measurement of each slice will tell you two pieces of information:
            (1) how many 3s to keep and
            (2) how well you know the final 3.
            In this example, both <m>0.33 \pm 0.01</m> and <m>0.33 \pm 0.04</m> imply that the measurement is accurate to two decimal places,
            but the first implies that you trust the second 3 more than if you report it as the second number.</p>
            <aside>
            <title>CAUTION:</title>
            <p>Because physicists <q>know what we mean</q>, they are often sloppy with their language and use
            the words <q>error</q> and <q>uncertainty</q> interchangeably.

            <li><title>accuracy</title>
            <p>How close a number is to the true (but usually unknowable) result.
            This is usually expressed by the (absolute or relative) error.
            </p></li>
            <li><title>precision</title>
            <p> How well you trust the measurement.
            This is vaguely expressed by the number of decimals, or clearly expressed by the size of the (absolute or relative) uncertainty.

            <title>Writing an Analysis of Error</title>

            <introduction>

            <p>The conclusion of your lab report should be based on an analysis of the error in the experiment.
            The analysis of error is one of the most certain gauges available to the instructor by which the student's
            scientific insight can be evaluated.  To be done well, this analysis calls for comments about the factors
            that impacted the extent to which the experimental results agree with the theoretical value (what factors
            impact the percent error), the limitations and restrictions of the instruments used (what factors impact the
            uncertainty), and the legitimacy of the assumptions.</p>

            <p>Physicists usually use the phrase <q>sources of error</q> (or <q>sources of uncertainty</q>) to describe
            how the limits of measurement propagate through a calculation (see <xref ref="ss-propagation" text="title" />)
            to impact the <term>uncertainty</term> in the final result.  This type of <q>error analysis</q> gives insight into the
            <term>accuracy</term> of the result.  <xref ref="sss-considerations" text="title" /> provides questions that can help you
            describe which of several measurements can most effectively improve the <term>precision</term> of the result
            so that you can gain insight into the <term>accuracy</term> of the result.  The accuracy allows one to gauge
            the veracity (truth) of an underlying relationship, but precision allows you to gauge accuracy.  Said another
            way, a small <term>percent difference</term> usually is used to imply a small <term>percent error</term>.
            Said another way, imprecise measurements always <em>seem</em> accurate.</p>

            </introduction>

        <subsection xml:id="sss-mistakes">
            <title>Technically, Errors are not Mistakes</title>

            <p>Your report should not list <q>human error</q> because most students misunderstand this term to mean
            <q>places I might have made a mistake</q> rather than <q>the limiting factor when using the equipment correctly.</q>
            <xref ref="ss-precision" text="title" /> discusses measurement uncertainties as defined above.</p>

            <p>In the example of the apple above, the fact that one person has <m>0.33 \pm 0.04</m> of an apple does
            <em>not</em> reflect a <q>mistake</q> in the cutting, but rather reflects that the cutter is limited in their precision.
            What is important is to use the uncertainty to express how well one can repeated cut the apple into thirds.
            The absolute uncertainty of <m>0.04</m> is generally interpreted to say that most instances
            (roughly <m>68\%</m>, as explained in <xref ref="sss-multiple-precision" text="title" />) of the cutting of an apple in this way
            will result in having between <m>0.29</m> to <m>0.37</m> of an apple for any given slice.</p>

            <p>When describing the cause of an error (difference from the theoretical value) or of an uncertainty
            (the extent you trust a number), you can usually categorize this source of error as a random error
            (a cause that could skew the result too large <em>or</em> too small) or as a systematic error
            (a cause that tends to skew the result in one particular direction).
            <dl>
            <li><title>Random Error</title>
                <p> An environmental circumstances, generally uncontrollable, that sometimes makes the measured result too high and
                sometimes make it too low in an unpredictable fashion.  Random errors may have a statistical origin -- that is, they
                are due to chance.  For example, if one hundred pennies are dumped on a table, on average we expect that fifty would
                land heads up.  But we should not be surprised if fifty-three or forty-seven actually landed heads-up.
                This deviation is statistical in nature because the way in which a penny lands is due to chance.
                Random errors can sometimes be reduced by either collecting more data and averaging the readings,
                or by using instruments with greater precision.
                </p></li>
            <li xml:id="li-systematic-error"><title>Systematic Error</title>
                <p> A systematic error can be ascribed to a factor which would tend to push the result in a certain direction away
                from the theory value.  The error would make all of the results either systematically too high or systematically to low.
                One key idea here is that systematic errors can be eliminated or reduced if the factor causing the error can be
                eliminated or controlled.  This is sometimes a big <q>if</q>, because not all factors can be controlled.
                Systematic errors can be caused by instruments which are not calibrated correctly, maybe a <term>zero-point error</term>
                (an error with the zero reading of the instrument).  This type of error can usually be found and corrected.
                Systematic errors also often arise because the experimental setup is somehow different from that assumed in the theory.
                If the acceleration due to gravity was measured to be
<quantity><mag>9.52</mag><unit base="meter" /><per base="second" exp="2" /></quantity>
                with an experimental uncertainty (precision) of
<quantity><mag>0.05</mag><unit base="meter" /><per base="second" exp="2" /></quantity>,
                rather than the textbook value of
<quantity><mag>9.81</mag><unit base="meter" /><per base="second" exp="2" /></quantity>,
                then we should be concerned with why the accuracy is
                not as good as the precision.  This is most likely to mean that there is a significant systematic error in the experiment,
                where one of the initial assumptions may not be valid.  The textbook value does not consider the effects of the air.
                The effects of the air may or may not be controllable, and the difference between the theory and the data may be
                (within appropriate limits or tests) considered a correction factor for the systematic error.

        <title>Considerations for the Error Analysis</title>

        <p> In order to help you get started on your  discussion of error, the following list of questions is provided.
        It is not an exhaustive list.  You need not answer all of these questions in a single report.
        <ol>
        <li><p> Is the error large or small? Is it random or systematic? <ellipsis /> statistical? <ellipsis /> cumulative?
            <ol>
            <li><p> What accuracy (precision) was expected? Why? What accuracy (precision) was attained? If different, why? </p></li>
            <li><p> Was the experimental technique sensitive enough? Was the effect masked by noise? </p></li>
            </ol> </p></li>
        <li><p> Is it possible to determine which measurements are responsible for greater percent error by checking items
        measured and reasoning from the physical principles, the nature of the measuring instrument, and using the rules
        for propagation of error?
            <ol>
            <li><p> Is the error partly attributable to the fact that the experimental set-up did not approximate the ideal
            that was required by the physical theory closely enough? How did it fail? </p></li>
            <li><p> If a systematic error skews high (low), then is your result too high (low)?
            Is this a reasonable explanation?  Is the size of the skew enough to explain the result? </p></li>
            <li><p> What can be done to improve the equipment and eliminate error? How can the influence of environmental factors be diminished?
            Why is this so? </p></li>

    <title>Finding the Precision of a Measurement</title>

        <subsection xml:id="sss-multiple-precision">
        <title>Uncertainty of multiple, repeated measurements</title>

        <p>Calculate or estimate the precision of a measurement by one or more of the following methods:
        <ol>
        <li><p> by the precision of the measuring instrument, and take into account any uncertainties that are intrinsic to the object itself; </p></li>
        <li><p> by the range of values obtained, the minimum and/or maximum deviation <m>(d)</m>;
            <me> d_i = \left| X_i - X_{\rm ave} \right| </me>  </p></li>
        <li><p> by the standard deviation, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual deviations <m>(d)</m>
        divided by the number of readings <m>(N)</m> minus one;
            <me> \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{(N-1)} \sum d^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{(N-1)} \sum_i \left| X_i - X_{\rm ave} \right|^2} </me> </p></li>
        <li><p> by the standard deviation of the mean, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of readings; </p></li>
        <li><p> by the square root of the number of readings <m>(\sqrt{N})</m>, if <m>N</m> is considered large; </p></li>
        </ol></p>

        <p>If many data points were taken and plotted on a histogram, it would smooth out and approach the symmetrical graph typical
        of the binomial distribution (see the Figure <xref ref="f-histogram" /><!-- on page~\pageref{f:histogram} -->).
        This distribution and many others in statistics may be approximated by the gaussian distribution. </p>

        <p> The standard deviation, <m>\sigma</m>, can be estimated from the above graph.  It is a measure of the <q>width</q> of the distribution.
        For the case shown, the standard deviation has the value of five.  The greater the standard deviation, the wider the distribution
        and the less likely that an individual reading will be close to the average value.  About <m>68\%</m> of the individual readings fall
        within one standard deviation (between 45 and 55 in this case).  About <m>96\%</m> of the readings fall within two standard deviations
        (between 40 and 60 in this case). </p>

        <p> As more and more readings are taken, the effect of the random error is gradually eliminated.
        In the absence of systematic error, the average value of the readings should gradually approach the true value.
        The smooth curve above was drawn assuming that there was no systematic error.
        If there were, the graph would merely be displaced sideways.  The average value for the number would then be say 55. </p>

        <p> The distribution of many average (mean) readings is also gaussian in shape.
        Comparing this to the distribution for individual readings, it is much narrower.
        We would expect this, since each reading on this graph is an average of individual readings and has much less random error.
        By taking an average of readings, a considerable portion of the random error has been canceled.
        The standard deviation for this distribution is called the standard deviation of the mean (<m>\sigma_m</m>).
        For this distribution, <m>68\%</m> of the averages of the readings are within one standard deviation of the mean,
        and <m>98\%</m> of the average readings fall within two standard deviations of the mean. </p>


        <p> The standard deviation of the mean tells how close a particular <em>average</em> of several readings is likely to be
        to an overall average when many readings are taken.  The standard deviation tells how close an <em>individual</em> reading
        is likely to be to the average.</p>

        <p>There is one case for which the standard deviation can be estimated from one reading.  In counting experiments
        (radioactivity, for example), the distribution is a Poisson distribution.  For this distribution, the standard deviation
        is just the square root of the average reading.  One reading can give an estimate of the average, and therefore, give an
        estimate of-the standard deviation.</p>

    <section xml:id="ss-propagation">
    <title>Propagation of Uncertainties</title>

    <p> The previous sections discussed the uncertainties of directly measured quantities.
    Now we need to consider how these uncertainties affect the rest of the analysis.
    In most experiments, the analysis or final results are obtained by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing the primary data.
    The uncertainty in the final result is therefore a combination of the errors in the primary data.
    The way in which the error propagates from the primary data through the calculations to the final result may be summarized as follows:
    <ol>
    <li xml:id="add"><p> The error to be assigned to the sum or difference of two quantities is equal to the sum of their absolute errors. </p></li>
    <li xml:id="mult"><p> Relative error is the ratio of the absolute error to the quantity itself.
    The relative error to be assigned to the product or quotient of two quantities is the sum of their relative errors.</p></li>
    <li><p> The relative error to be assigned to the power of a quantity is the power times the relative error of the quantity itself.</p></li>
    </ol>
    These rules are not arbitrary, but rather they follow directly from the nature of the mathematical operations.
    These rules may be derived using calculus.  </p>

    <title>Significant Figures only <em>approximates</em> Uncertainty</title>

    <p> The precision/accuracy of any measurement or number is approximated by writing the number with a convention called using
    <term>significant figures</term>.  Every measuring instrument can be read with only so much precision and no more.
    For example, a meter stick can be used to measure the length of a small metal rod to one-tenth of a millimeter,
    whereas a micrometer can be used to measure the length to one-thousandth of a millimeter.
    When reporting these two measurements, the precision is indicated by the number of digits used to express the result.
    You should always record your data and results using the convention of significant figures.
    </p>

    <p> To give a specific example, suppose that the rod mentioned above was <m>52.430\unit{mm}</m> long.
    When making this measurement with the meter stick, you would count off the total number of millimeters in the
    length of the rod and then add your best guess that the rod was four-tenths of a millimeter longer than that.
    Using the micrometer, you would count off the hundredths of a millimeter and then add your best guess of the
    number of thousandths of a millimeter, to complete the measurement.  How would you communicate the fact that
    one measurement is more precise than the other?  If you wrote both quantities in the same way, you could not tell which was which.
    </p>

    <p> The rules for <term>significant figures</term>:
    <!-- These need to be conventions, not asides -->
    <ol>
    <li><p>Significant figures include all certain digits plus the first of the doubtful digits.</p>

    <p><convention><p>The reading obtained from the meter stick would be written as 52.4 mm;
    all digits up to and including the first doubtful digit.  The reading from the micrometer would be written as 52.430 mm.
    The first doubtful digit in the case of the meter stick is .4 mm.  The first doubtful digit in the case of the micrometer
    is zero-thousandths of a millimeter.  Note that the number of significant figures is related to the precision of the
    measuring instrument -- it is not an abstraction about the number.</p>

    <p>Sometimes the character zero is confusing.  See <xref ref="sig-rule-zero">Rule</xref>.</p>
    </convention></p>
    </li>
    <li xml:id="sig-rule-zero"><p>Zeros to the right of the number are significant; zeros on the left are not.</p>

    <p><convention><p>In the example above, the reading of the micrometer was given as 52.430 mm.
    The zero is a significant figure, it communicates the fact that the micrometer measurement is good to a thousandth of a millimeter.
    Zeros used to the left of significant digits to position the decimal point are not significant.
    They are not communicating the precision of the measurement.  For example, if the measurement from the meter stick were
    written as 0.0524 meter, the zeros would not be significant digits.  Because of the units (meters instead of millimeters),
    the decimal point had to be moved to the left.  This measurement still has only three significant figures.
    </p></convention></p>

    <example><p>Suppose that you wished to give the meter stick measurement in terms of microns <m>(\mu)</m>
    (1 micron = 1 millionth of a meter).   We determined that the meter stick reading has 3 sig. figs.,
    one good way to write this  is to use scientific notation.  Write the number as <m>5.24\ten{4}\unit{microns}</m>.
    The factor of <m>10^4</m> shows the order of magnitude, while the <m>5.24</m> retains the proper number of significant figures.
    </p>
    <p>Study the following examples:
        <table>
        <tabular>
                <row><cell> <m>5.24 \unit{cm}</m> </cell><cell> 3 significant figures </cell></row>
                <row><cell> <m>52.4 \unit{mm}</m> </cell><cell> 3 significant figures </cell></row>
                <row><cell> <m>0.0524 \unit{m}</m> </cell><cell> 3 significant figures </cell></row>
                <row><cell> <m>5.24\ten{4}\unit{\mu m}</m> </cell><cell> 3 significant figures </cell></row>
                <row><cell> <m>52.430 \unit{mm}</m> </cell><cell> 5 significant figures </cell></row>
                <row><cell> <m>0.052430 \unit{m}</m> </cell><cell> 5 significant figures </cell></row>
                <row><cell> <m>5.2430\ten{4}\unit{\mu m}</m> </cell><cell> 5 significant figures </cell></row>
                <row><cell> <m>52430 \unit{\mu m}</m>  </cell><cell> 4 significant figures </cell></row>
                <row><cell> <m>52430.\unit{\mu m}</m>  </cell><cell> 5 significant figures </cell></row>
        </tabular>
        <caption>Examples of numbers and how to count significant digits</caption>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>Because all measurements are limited in their precision, then all results derived from these measurements are also
    limited in their precision.  Many students get carried away with the number of digits produced by a calculator and
    mislead the reader by reporting their results with more significant figures than their data permits.
    Form the habit of rejecting all figures which will have no influence in the final result and report the result with only
    the number of significant digits allowed by the data.  The following rules will help you do this successfully.
    </p></example>
    </li>
    <li><p>Round the number, increasing by one the last digit retained if the following digit is greater than five.</p>

    <p><convention><p>Because the use of significant digits is meant to be an approximation to the more precise
    use of measurement uncertainty, the convention for the rounding of the final digit is not critical and is treated a little
    differently by different scientists.  Some round-up anything five-or-more.  Some round-down anything five-or-less.
    Some round the five up or down based on whether the next digit is even or odd.  This third choice is intended to express that
    we don't actually know which way to round it and letting the randomness of the next digit make the determination is like
    flipping a coin. <alert>You should ask your instructor, which approach they prefer.</alert></p></convention></p></li>

    <li><p>In addition and subtraction, carry the result only up to the first doubtful decimal place of any of the starting numbers.</p></li>

    <li><p>In multiplication and division, retain as many significant figures in the answer as there are in the
    starting number with the smallest number of significant figures.</p></li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>When determining or estimating the experimental uncertainty, the precision of the measuring instrument is important,
    as shown in the above examples.  But you must also be aware of other experimental factors.  For example, a good stopwatch
    may have a precision of 0.01 seconds.  Is this the total uncertainty of the measurement?  You must remember that our
    physical reaction time maybe another 0.3 seconds.  This is more than 10 times larger than the precision of the timer.
    This is very significant.   Another example is trying to measure the diameter of a fuzzy cotton ball with a micrometer.
    Why is this not a very productive procedure?  There are major uncertainties here that are intrinsic to the object itself
    and are unrelated to the measuring instrument.  One must use common sense when estimating these uncertainties.
    </p>

    <p>The <term>actual uncertainty</term> written in the units of the measurement, may not convey a sense of how good the precision is.
    A better measure of the precision is given by the relative uncertainty.  This is defined as the actual uncertainty divided by
    the measurement itself and multiplied by 100, the <term>relative uncertainty</term> does not carry any units, just a <m>\%</m>.

<appendix xml:id="graphics"> <title>Discovering Relationships <mdash/> Graphical Analysis</title>

    <introduction>
    <p>The primary purpose of experimentation is to discover relationships between various physical quantities.
    This is usually best achieved with a graphical analysis.  Graphs of data and/or graphs of other results can be very enlightening.
    We often try to choose to plot variables for a graph so that the resulting relationship is linear, whose slope and intercept
    may be of physical interest.
    </p></introduction>

    <section xml:id="ss-linear">
    <title>Linear Relationships</title>

    <p>When two quantities are related, there are many, many possible mathematical relationships.
    The simplest relationship is the direct proportion.  This relationship is represented on a graph by a straight line
    which goes through the origin.  The linear relationship is similar, it however, may have an intercept with a coordinate axes.
    The general equation for a straight line is:
    <me>	y = mx + b, </me>
    where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are the plotted quantities, <m>m</m> is the slope, <m>b</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept.
    The slope and intercepts of a linear relationship often have physical significance.  It is therefore very important to calculate
    the slope and intercept and then for you to interpret their meaning, and  always give the units of the slope and intercept.
    The slope can be computed by choosing two places, <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, on the straight line.
    The slope is then given by
    <me> m  =  \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} </me>
    </p>

    </section>

    <section xml:id="nonlinear">
    <title>Linearizing Non-Linear graphs</title>

    <p>Most relationships which are not linear, can be graphed so that the graph is a straight line.
    This process is called a linearization of the data.  This does not change the fundamental relationship or what it represents,
    but it does change how the graph looks. The goal of this method is that it gives an excellent and easy method for obtaining
    a mathematical representation of the data.
    </p>

    <p>For example, the equation
    <me> X \times Y = \mbox{constant} </me>
    represents an <em>inverse proportion</em> between <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>.
    A graph of this equation is not a straight line with a negative slope.  Think about this and sketch the curve for yourself.
    This relationship can be graphed in such a way so that the new graph is a straight line.  This change is accomplished by
    choosing a new set of axes, and plotting new numbers which are related to the original set.  In this case if we would plot
    <m>1/X</m> on the x-axis instead of just <m>X</m>, this will yield a straight line graph.  Try it.
    </p>


    <p>There are many other possible relationships which are easy to linearize.  These include: exponential function,
    trigonometric functions, and power functions (squares, square roots, etc.)  A change of either the x or y-axis may
    linearize a function for you.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" >
        <p>To linearize the <em>power relationship</em>
        <me> Y = Bx^M,</me>
        take the natural logarithms of both sides to obtain
        <me> \ln(Y) = \ln(B) + M \ln(X).</me>
        If one plots <m>\ln(Y)</m> on the vertical and <m>\ln(X)</m> on the horizontal (a <q>log-log</q> graph),
        then the graph of this function yields a straight line with slope <m>M</m> and intercept <m>\ln(B)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>To linearize the <em>exponential relationship</em>,
        <me> Y = B e^{MX},</me>
        take the logarithm of both sides to obtain
        <me> \ln(Y) = \ln(B) + MX,</me>
        and again a graph of this function yields a straight line graph.
        If one plots <m>\ln(Y)</m> on the vertical and <m>X</m> on the horizontal (a <q>semi-log</q> graph),
        then the graph of this function yields a straight line with slope <m>M</m> and intercept <m>\ln(B)</m>.
